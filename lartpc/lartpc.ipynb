    "# The Unspoken Truth About Liquid Argon TPC\n",
    "\n",
    ">Liquid Argon TPC (LArTPC) works as an electronic bubble chamber.\n",
    "\n",
    "A [bubble chamber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_chamber), or its uncle [cloud chamber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_chamber), is a vessel filled with a superheated transparent liquid (or supersaturated vapor for a cloud chamber) to detect electrically charged particles moving through it. The trails of bubbles left behind by the particle tracks can then be examined by observers or photographed from all angles for detailed physics studies.\n",

    "\n",
    "Although very useful and popular at the time, the need for a photographic readout rather than three-dimensional electronic data makes the bubble/cloud chamber less convenient, especially in experiments which must be reset, repeated and analyzed many times. Therefore, when [time projection chamber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_projection_chamber) was invented, it was immediately welcomed by physicists because it allows them to study the electronically recorded 3D signals with a computer. LArTPC is like a TPC but uses liquid argon as a sensitive medium instead of gas, hence the nickname \"electronic bubble chamber\".\n",
    "\n",
    "But, there is a catch.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **\"LArTPC as an electronic bubble chamber\"** analogy only holds if the signals from the drifting electrons on all pixels of the anode planes are recorded, that is, if a **pad readout** is used. For many reasons (high cost, high thermal output, etc.), LArTPC experiments often have to reduce the number of electronic channels by using a **wire readout** that sums up the signals along parallel wires. Typically, three wireplanes are used to record the signals at three different view angles. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once **a LArTPC with a wire readout** is used, it stops functioning as an electronic bubble chamber, as the freedom of observe the 3D tracks from any angles are gone. A more appropriate analogy now is that a LArTPC with a wire readout functions as a **\"a physicist's CAT scan\"**. \n",

    "A computerized axial tomography (CAT) scan is a special type of X-ray used for viewing the internal organs of patients.\n",
    "The CAT scanner takes many X-ray images from different angles (typically at a step of 1 degree), then use computer algorithms to reconstruct the cross-sectional image of the scanning object. The underlining bed is used to move the patients and scan different parts of the body. The word **\"axial\"** (the A in CAT) refers to the fact that the angles that these X-ray images are taken from are rotations from a common axis. In CAT scan, this is the direction to move the human. \n",
    "\n",
    "The analogy should be clear now. In LArTPC, the \"patients\" are the ionizing electrons from particle tracks and showers. The \"X-rays\" are the wires that detect the electrons. The \"axis\" is the direction of the electric field. At each slice of along the axis, a \"CAT scan\" is performed by the wires. However, instead of taking 180 pictures at 1 degree per step as the CAT scan does, the typical three-wire-plane setup in LArTPC only record three pictures at 0, 60, and 120 degrees. We should probably call a LArTPC with a wire readout \"a **poor** physicist's CAT scan\" to reflect this unfortunate truth.\n",

    ">But the three 2D images look gorgeous!\n",
    "\n",
    "True, they are gorgeous. They are high resolution. They are digital. But inspite of all the merits, there is a fundamental limitation: they are **axial** images, so they can't show details in the plane perpendicular to the drifting direction. Since that plane is in fact parallel to the wire planes, we'll just call it **\"the parallel plane\"** from now on. \n",
    "\n",
    "*Homer Simpson* likes donuts and believes donut is the solution to everything, so we'll use a donut to illustrate this problem. Imagine that we have a donut of electrons parallel to the wire planes, and they are drifting toward the anode planes. Here is a challege to every smart physicist: *\"Given the three gorgeous images recorded by the three wire planes, can you find out that there is a hole in the middle of the donut?\"*\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    ">But we are detecting particle tracks, not donuts!\n",
    "\n",
    "Fair enough. Perhaps donut isn't the solution to everthing after all. Let's use a more realistic example: a two-track event parallel to the wire-plane. Let's see if we can reconstruct the two tracks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we do that, let me point out one more thing in the previous donut example. It turns out you actually can find out there is a hole in the middle of the donut, provided that\n",
    "* you take enough axial projections at different angles, certaintly more the three.\n",
    "* you include the signal strength in the analysis, after all, a full disk's signal strength is different from a hollow disk's.\n",
