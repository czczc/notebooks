    "# The Unspoken Truth About Liquid Argon TPC\n",

    ">Liquid Argon TPC (LArTPC) works as an electronic bubble chamber.\n",
    "\n",
    "A [bubble chamber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_chamber), or its uncle [cloud chamber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_chamber), is a vessel filled with a superheated transparent liquid (or supersaturated vapor for a cloud chamber) to detect electrically charged particles moving through it. The trails of bubbles left behind by the particle tracks can then be examined by observers or photographed from all angles for detailed physics studies.\n",

    "</table>\n",
    "\n",
    "Although very useful and popular at the time, the need for a photographic readout rather than three-dimensional electronic data makes the bubble/cloud chamber less convenient, especially in experiments which must be reset, repeated and analyzed many times. Therefore, when [time projection chamber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_projection_chamber) was invented, it was immediately welcomed by physicists because it allows them to study the electronically recorded 3D images with a computer. A liquid argon TPC (LArTPC) is a TPC that uses liquid argon as a sensitive medium instead of gas, hence the nickname \"electronic bubble chamber\".\n",
    "\n",
    "But, there is a catch.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **\"LArTPC as an electronic bubble chamber\"** analogy only holds if the signals from the drifting electrons are recorded for all pixels on the anode planes, that is, if a **pad readout** scheme is used. For many reasons (high cost, high thermal output, etc.), LArTPC experiments often have to reduce the number of electronic channels by using a **wire readout** scheme that sums up the signals along parallel wires. Typically, three wire planes are used to record the signals at three different view angles. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once **a LArTPC with wire readout** is used, it stops functioning as an electronic bubble chamber, as the freedom to observe the 3D tracks from any angles are gone. A more appropriate analogy is that it now functions more or less as a **\"CAT scan\"**. \n",

    "A computerized axial tomography (CAT) scan is a special type of X-ray used for viewing the internal organs of patients.\n",
    "The CAT scanner takes many X-ray images from different angles (typically at a step of 1 degree), then use computer algorithms to reconstruct the cross-sectional image of the scanning object. A mobile platform is used to move the patients in one direction to scan different parts of the body. The word **\"axial\"** (the A in CAT) refers to the fact that the angles that these X-ray images are taken from are rotated along a common axis. In CAT scan, that axis is the direction to move the patient. \n",
    "\n",
    "The analogy should be obvious now. In LArTPC, the \"patients\" are the ionizing electrons from particle tracks and showers. The \"X-rays\" are the wires that detect the electrons. The \"axis\" is the direction of the electric field. At each slice along the axis, a \"CAT scan\" of the ionizing electrons is performed by the wires. However, instead of taking 180 pictures at 1 degree per step as the CAT scan does, the typical three-wire-plane setup in LArTPC only record three pictures at 0, 60, and 120 degrees. To reflect this unfortunate truth, we should probably call a LArTPC with wire readout \"a **poor** physicist's CAT scan\".\n",

    ">But the three 2D images look gorgeous!\n",
    "\n",
    "True, they are gorgeous. They are high-resolution. They are digital. But in spite of all the merits, there is a fundamental limitation: they are **axial** projections, so they can't show details in the plane perpendicular to the axis of rotation. Since that plane is in fact parallel to the wire planes, we'll just call it **\"the parallel plane\"** from now on. \n",
    "\n",
    "*Homer Simpson* likes donuts and believes donut is the solution to everything, so we'll use a donut to illustrate this problem. Imagine that we have a donut of electrons parallel to the wire planes, and they are drifting toward the anode planes. Here is a challenge to every smart physicist: *\"Given the three gorgeous images recorded by the three wire planes, can you find out that there is a hole in the middle of the donut?\"*\n",

    "\n",
    ">But we are detecting particle tracks, not donuts!\n",
    "\n",
    "Fair enough. Perhaps donut isn't the solution to everything after all. Let's use a simple but more realistic example: a two-track event parallel to the wire-plane. Let's see if we can reconstruct such two tracks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we do that, let me point out one more thing in the previous donut example. It turns out you actually can find out there is a hole in the middle of the donut, provided that\n",

    "* you include the signal strength in the analysis, after all, a full disk's signal strength is different from a hollow disk's.\n",

    "> But the phase space of exactly parallel tracks is zero!\n",
    "\n",
    "True, the phase space of *exactly* anything is zero. But by the same argument, [Zeno's arrow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeno%27s_paradoxes#Arrow_paradox) was never flying.\n",
    "\n",
    "The truth is, due the diffusion of electrons and the shaping time of electronics, there is an intrinsic spacial resolution along the drifting axis, which is about 3 cm. So the track doesn't need to be *exactly* parallel to the wire planes. As long as it's inside this 3 cm thick slice, we can't really tell its difference from a parallel track.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can easily estimate the length of such a track inside the slice, which is a characteristic number that we can call **\"degeneracy length\"**, or $L_d$. The degeneracy length $L_d$ depends on the angle of the track w.r.t the wire planes. \n",
    "* If the angle is $1^{\\circ}$, $L_d$ is approximately $(3 \\textrm{cm}) / \\sin1^{\\circ} \\approx 170 \\textrm{cm}$. More specifically, it means that if you have any other tracks, or shower fragments, within this 170 cm x 170 x 3 cm slab, you won't be able to resolve them as they are \"shadowed\" by this 170 cm long $1^{\\circ}$ track. This is the consequence of the wire readout, because we are restricted to only three axial projections.\n",
    "* At $5^{\\circ}$, $L_d$ becomes 34 cm.\n",

How do we propagate that uncertainty into the analysis?\n",

    "When we add showers into the consideration, the situation becomes a little more complicated.

For tracks, it means that we want them to have a large angle w.r.t the wire planes; for showers, it means that we want them to develop along a large angle w.r.t the wire planes so that activities in each slice is minimized. As long as most of our events are that way, we are probably fine.\n",
