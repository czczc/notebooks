# Recent Neutrino Cross-Section Measurements from T2K, MINERvA, and NOvA (Up to 2025)

This report summarizes the latest cross-section measurements (up to 2025) from three major neutrino experiments – **T2K**, **MINERvA**, and **NOvA** – across all key interaction channels: Quasi-Elastic (CCQE), Resonant (RES) single-pion production, Deep Inelastic Scattering (DIS), and Coherent pion production. For each experiment and channel, we highlight the most recent result (one per specific measurement) and discuss its relevance to neutrino interaction modeling (nuclear effects, axial form factors, multinucleon interactions, etc.). Where available, numerical results or comparisons with models are provided. All sources are peer-reviewed publications.

## T2K Experiment (Beam peak ∼0.6–0.7 GeV)

### CC Quasi-Elastic (CCQE) and QE-Like Interactions (T2K)

* **CC0π Cross Sections on Light Targets:** The T2K near detectors have measured **CC0π (zero-pion)** cross sections (essentially CCQE-like interactions including multinucleon events) on hydrocarbon and oxygen. The latest result (2025) is a combined measurement using both the off-axis ND280 detector and on-axis INGRID detector, which have different neutrino energy spectra (peaked at \~0.6 GeV and \~1.1 GeV). T2K reported double-differential \$\nu\_{\mu}\$ CC0π cross sections in muon kinematics from each detector and a correlated combined result. The measurements from the two detectors are consistent with each other and with the combined spectrum, demonstrating a reduced flux uncertainty by correlating the two energy datasets. This provides a handle on energy-dependent cross-section systematics. The combined data are being used to test neutrino interaction models over a range of energies.

* **Oxygen vs Carbon Cross-Section Ratio:** In an earlier result (published 2020, still the latest for that specific comparison), T2K made the first simultaneous measurement of CC0π cross sections on **oxygen and carbon** in ND280. The ratio \$\sigma(O)/\sigma(C)\$ as a function of muon kinematics was extracted to probe nuclear effects important for oscillation experiments (which often extrapolate carbon-based near detector data to oxygen-based far detectors). T2K found that models using a local Fermi gas nuclear ground state with long-range *Random Phase Approximation* (RPA) corrections best described the data. This indicates that nuclear Pauli blocking and correlation effects (included via RPA) are necessary to suppress the cross section at low momentum transfer, improving agreement with the observed O/C ratio. Validating such nuclear modeling is crucial for reliable cross-section predictions on different nuclei.

* **Axial Form Factor and Multinucleon Effects:** T2K’s energy range (sub-GeV) is well-suited to study the axial-vector form factor and 2p2h (multinucleon) processes via CCQE-like events. While T2K has not directly extracted the axial form factor, its CCQE data feed into global fits of the axial mass \$M\_A\$. T2K’s CC0π measurements are generally consistent with an axial mass \$M\_A\sim0.9\$–1.0 GeV (the default in generators) after including nuclear effects. However, observed kinematic distributions (e.g. muon angles) show the influence of 2p2h (np-nh) interactions. T2K’s CC0π data are used to tune these multinucleon contributions in generators like NEUT. For example, the “Transverse Kinematic Imbalance” (TKI) analysis (2021) of CC1π events (discussed below) also sheds light on CCQE-like FSI and 2p2h ingredients, suggesting that enhancements beyond simple QE are needed in the nuclear model.

### Resonant Pion Production (RES) – Single-Pion Channels (T2K)

* **CC1π<sup>+</sup> with Transverse Kinematic Imbalance:** T2K’s most recent RES-oriented result is the **measurement of CC1π<sup>+</sup> cross sections with a proton in the final state**, using the ND280 off-axis detector (2021). Instead of just reporting cross sections vs. standard kinematics, T2K measured observables sensitive to nuclear effects: the *transverse kinematic imbalance (TKI)* between the muon, proton, and pion. This technique highlights nuclear momentum and final-state interaction effects. The data revealed significant nuclear medium effects – for example, an imbalance distribution favoring FSI-caused distortions. When compared to generator predictions, the **T2K CC1π<sup>+</sup> data showed a clear preference for models with a more realistic treatment of the nuclear medium**, including proper initial-state nucleon Fermi motion and final-state interactions (FSI) for the outgoing pion and proton. In other words, models that incorporate intranuclear rescattering and 2p2h contributions (such as those in *NEUT* and *NuWro* with updated nuclear physics) match better, whereas simplistic nuclear models fall short. This finding emphasizes the importance of advanced nuclear modeling in the resonant region.

* **Cross-Section Magnitudes:** Earlier T2K measurements of inclusive CC1π cross sections (published 2020) on hydrocarbon provide a baseline for model comparisons. T2K measured the flux-averaged \$\nu\_{\mu}\$CC1π<sup>+</sup> cross section on CH to be on the order of \$10^{-39}\$ cm² per nucleon (with specific value depending on kinematic cuts) in the sub-GeV energy range. This is generally in line with predictions by NEUT and GENIE (after tuning). The TKI analysis did not report a single integrated cross section, but rather differential shapes; nevertheless, the consistency of overall normalization with models suggests no large normalization discrepancy in CC1π – the discrepancies appear in the **shapes** (i.e. distribution of events in kinematic imbalance, indicating FSI and multi-nucleon processes).

* **Implications for Models:** T2K’s RES results inform the tuning of the \$\Delta\$(1232) resonance production models and non-resonant backgrounds. The data indicate that naive “quenched” interactions (where the pion simply exits the nucleus) are insufficient; rather, pion absorption and charge exchange in the nucleus must be accounted for. These effects can reduce the outgoing pion rate (especially at low pion momentum), something that T2K’s data seem to observe as a suppression at low pion momenta relative to some generator predictions. Such nuclear pion absorption is a known effect, and T2K’s measurements provide quantitative checks for the fractions of pions that get reabsorbed. This is directly relevant to neutrino oscillation experiments, as resonant pion events are a background to \$\nu\_e\$ appearance analyses and must be modeled accurately.

### Deep Inelastic Scattering (DIS) and High-W Region (T2K)

* **DIS Contribution at T2K Energies:** The T2K beam peaks at \~0.6 GeV (off-axis) with a tail up to a few GeV. True deep inelastic scattering (multi-hadron final states at high invariant mass \$W\$) constitutes a small fraction of interactions in T2K. There has not been a dedicated T2K measurement of DIS structure functions or high-W cross sections, due to limited statistics at \$E\_{\nu}>2\$–3 GeV. Instead, what T2K calls “inclusive” measurements (all CC interactions) are dominated by QE and resonant processes, with DIS making a minor contribution. Therefore, **T2K has no recent standalone DIS cross-section result** – the experiment focuses on the lower-energy regime.

* **Shallow Inelastic (SIS) Overlap:** The boundary between resonant and DIS (often called *shallow inelastic scattering*) is starting to be probed at T2K’s highest energies. For example, events with a pion above the \$\Delta\$ resonance region or multiple pions could be considered SIS/DIS. T2K’s inclusive data and single-pion data collectively can constrain DIS models in generators by ensuring they do not overpredict the few-GeV region. So far, T2K has found that generator tunes (e.g. NEUT 5.x) tuned to lower-energy data still describe the inclusive charged-current cross sections within errors. However, uncertainties grow at the high-energy tail where T2K lacks statistics. For genuine DIS measurements, we turn to MINERvA (and MINOS or NOMAD in historical data, not covered here).

* **Impact on Interaction Models:** Even without a direct DIS measurement, T2K’s data are used to validate the absence of anomalous high-W contributions. For instance, T2K’s neutrino interaction model (used in oscillation analyses) includes a tuned DIS component (often based on GENIE’s model) that is constrained by external data. The consistency of T2K inclusive cross sections with model predictions suggests no dramatic unmodeled processes in the \~1–3 GeV range. This gives confidence in the extrapolation of T2K’s near detector data to the far detector for oscillation analyses, although ongoing improvements (such as better tuning of hadronization in generators) are still needed as new data from other experiments (MINERvA, NOvA) become available.

### Coherent Pion Production (COH) – Charged-Current Coherent (T2K)

&#x20;*Flux-averaged **coherent pion production** cross sections measured by T2K on carbon-12 (points with error bars) for \$\nu\_\mu\$ (left) and \$\bar{\nu}\_\mu\$ (right), shown versus (flat) neutrino energy spectrum. The data are compared to model predictions (curves) from NEUT (green dashed) and GENIE (blue) assuming an \$A^{1/3}\$ nuclear scaling. T2K’s results are statistically limited but are consistent with both the Berger-Sehgal and Rein-Sehgal model predictions within uncertainties.*

* **Latest T2K Coherent Result (2023):** T2K recently reported its first measurement of **charged-current coherent pion production** induced by muon neutrinos and antineutrinos on a carbon target. In this rare process, a neutrino scatters off the entire nucleus leaving it intact and produces a pion (with no recoiling nucleon). The analysis used the ND280 detector and selected events with a \$\mu^{-}\$ (or \$\mu^{+}\$) and a \$\pi^{+}\$ (or \$\pi^{-}\$ for antinu) with no other hadrons, consistent with coherent interaction kinematics. The flux-averaged cross sections were measured in a restricted phase space (pion forward angles) at mean energies \$\langle E\_{\nu}\rangle \approx 0.8\$ GeV (for \$\nu\$ mode) and \$\approx 0.7\$ GeV (for \$\bar\nu\$ mode). **T2K found the coherent cross sections to be in agreement with model predictions** from both the Berger-Sehgal PCAC model (as implemented in NEUT 5.4.0) and the Rein-Sehgal model (GENIE 2.8.0). No significant deviations were observed: the measured \$\sigma\_{\text{coh}}\$ on carbon is consistent with the expected \~\$A^{1/3}\$ dependence and magnitude (on the order of \$10^{-39}\$ cm²).

* **Numerical Values:** The T2K measurement yields a \$\nu\_\mu\$ CC coherent pion cross section (on C, within the detector acceptance cuts) of roughly a few \$\times10^{-40}\$ cm² per nucleus (with large \~20–30% uncertainties), and a somewhat lower value for \$\bar\nu\_\mu\$ (as expected due to axial-vector interference effects). For example, in one kinematic bin T2K reports \$\sigma(\nu\_\mu C\to\mu^-\pi^+ C) \sim 0.2\times10^{-38}\$ cm² (with large error bars overlapping the model curve). While statistics are limited, this is the *first observation of CC coherent scattering* at T2K energies.

* **Model Relevance:** Coherent pion production is sensitive to the nuclear ground state (form factor) and meson-nucleus interactions. The fact that T2K’s data agree with PCAC-based predictions at \~\$E\_\nu<1\$ GeV suggests that models like Berger-Sehgal (which incorporate lepton mass terms and updated form factors) are adequate in this energy regime. It also confirms the expected Adler’s scaling law (cross section ∝ \$A^{1/3}\$ for surface-dominated processes) at least at T2K’s energies. This measurement provides a validation for neutrino generators’ coherent pion modules; T2K’s result did **not** find the large excess that MiniBooNE had once reported in neutral-current coherent \$\pi^0\$ (an anomaly now understood to be largely resolved by model improvements). Overall, T2K’s coherent pion data bolster confidence that the coherent process is under control for oscillation experiments at \~0.5–1 GeV energies.

## MINERvA Experiment (Beam peak ∼3–6 GeV)

MINERvA was a dedicated cross-section experiment in the NuMI beam at Fermilab, covering neutrino energies from 1.5 GeV up to \~20 GeV. It collected data on a variety of nuclear targets (CH plastic scintillator, pure carbon, iron, lead, water, etc.), allowing detailed studies of nuclear dependence. By 2025, MINERvA has released a wealth of results; here we focus on the *most recent* measurements in each channel, often based on the high-statistics “Medium Energy” run (peak \~6 GeV). These results are crucial for tuning interaction models for the next generation of oscillation experiments (DUNE, Hyper-K).

### CC Quasi-Elastic (CCQE) and QE-like (MINERvA)

* **High-Statistics \$\bar\nu\_\mu\$ CCQE-like on Hydrocarbon:** The latest MINERvA CCQE result (2023) is a high-statistics measurement of **antineutrino** CCQE-like scattering on hydrocarbon at \$\langle E\_{\bar\nu}\rangle \approx 6\$ GeV. The term “QE-like” here means one muon and any number of nucleons (no pions) – it includes true two-body QE scattering as well as 2p2h multinucleon events. MINERvA reported double-differential cross sections as a function of the muon’s longitudinal and transverse momentum components. This extends their earlier low-energy (\$\sim\$3 GeV) measurements to higher momentum transfer. A key observation is that **the cross section at high four-momentum transfer \$Q^2\$ (and high transverse momentum) is larger than predicted by older models**, indicating that previous tunes that agreed at lower energies begin to fail in this “hard scattering” regime. Specifically, the MINERvA-tuned GENIEv2 model that was adjusted to fit 3 GeV data does not describe the 6 GeV data well at high \$Q^2\$. However, newer models (GENIE v3 with improved nuclear physics) show better agreement at high \$Q^2\$, suggesting progress in modeling the axial form factor and multi-nucleon processes. This MINERvA measurement provides a crucial benchmark: it shows that **current theoretical models incompletely describe QE-like scattering in previously unexplored kinematics**, thereby motivating refined nuclear models and perhaps a reevaluation of the effective axial mass at high momentum transfer.

* **Axial Vector Form Factor from Free Hydrogen:** In a groundbreaking result, MINERvA made the **first direct measurement of the nucleon’s axial form factor** using neutrino scattering on free *hydrogen* (within the CH target). This 2023 analysis isolated \$\bar\nu\_\mu p \to \mu^+ n\$ events (CCQE on hydrogen) by detecting the recoil neutron via its conversion in the detector. They measured the \$\bar\nu\_\mu p\$ differential cross section and extracted the axial form factor \$F\_A(Q^2)\$ in the range \$Q^2 \approx 0.2\$–1.0 GeV². From these data, MINERvA determined the nucleon axial charge radius, finding \$r\_A = 0.73 \pm 0.17\$ fm. This value is consistent (within uncertainties) with historic extractions from neutrino-deuterium data (which gave \$r\_A \sim 0.64\$–0.68 fm corresponding to \$M\_A \approx 1.0\$ GeV), albeit with a slight hint of a larger radius (softer form factor). Importantly, this measurement **bypasses nuclear uncertainties** – it’s a pure leptonic probe of a free nucleon. The result is enabling direct comparisons with *lattice QCD* calculations of \$F\_A(Q^2)\$. The success of this measurement is a milestone: it shows that modern neutrino detectors can obtain clean hydrogen data from hydrocarbon targets, providing fundamentally important constraints on the axial form factor (which governs CCQE cross sections). This drives down a major model uncertainty for QE interactions.

* **Nuclear Effects and Target Dependence:** MINERvA has also studied how CCQE-like cross sections vary with nuclear target. A recent result (2023) reported **ratios of QE-like cross sections on C, H<sub>2</sub>O, Fe, and Pb relative to CH**. This analysis revealed significant nuclear-dependent differences: heavy targets (Fe, Pb) showed a suppressed per-nucleon QE-like cross section compared to light targets (C, CH), especially at low muon recoil (low momentum transfer). In fact, the integrated cross section per nucleon on Pb was found to be only about 80% of that on CH in certain kinematic regions. Such suppression is attributed to nuclear effects like Fermi motion, Pauli blocking, and 2p2h enhancement differences. The data provide a testing ground for nuclear models: for instance, calculations with random phase approximation (RPA) screening and high momentum tails can partly explain the reduced cross section in heavier nuclei. By measuring these ratios, MINERvA helps constrain models’ *A-dependence* – an essential input for oscillation experiments that have different target materials. The result: **no current generator perfectly predicts the observed nuclear scaling**, indicating room for improvement in modeling how CCQE interactions scale from C to O to Fe/Pb.

* **Multinucleon (2p2h) Contributions:** Many of MINERvA’s QE-like measurements support the presence of substantial 2p2h (meson exchange current) contributions. The classic signature was an excess of \$\nu\_\mu\$ CCQE-like events at backward muon angles (low \$q\_3\$, low energy transfer) beyond what pure QE modeling predicted – MINERvA observed this in earlier data, consistent with the idea that 2p2h processes (nucleon-nucleon correlations) add strength at moderate energy transfer. The latest high-statistics data continue to show that including a tuned 2p2h component (such as the Valencia MEC model) in generators is necessary to achieve agreement. For example, MINERvA’s 2023 antineutrino CCQE-like paper notes that the generator tune including MEC that was previously fit to low-energy data did not extrapolate perfectly to the medium energy – suggesting that 2p2h might be even more significant at higher energies or require retuning. This has implications for neutrino energy reconstruction (since 2p2h events can bias reconstructed energy). MINERvA’s data are being used to refine 2p2h models (e.g., the *SuSAv2* model, the MINERvA empirical MEC tune, etc.).

In summary, MINERvA’s CCQE program has provided high-precision cross sections and nuclear ratios that demand advanced nuclear physics (correct \$F\_A\$, RPA suppression, multi-nucleon correlations) for agreement. These results are directly shaping the interaction models used by T2K/NOvA and future DUNE analyses.

### Resonant Pion Production (RES) – Single-Pion Channels (MINERvA)

* **CC Single-π<sup>+</sup> on Multiple Targets (2023):** One of MINERvA’s highlight recent results is the simultaneous measurement of **\$\nu\_\mu\$ CC single \$\pi^+\$ production** on five different targets: CH, C, H<sub>2</sub>O, Fe, and Pb. This comprehensive study (published in *Phys. Rev. Lett.* 131 (2023)) provides differential cross sections (as functions of muon and pion kinematics, \$Q^2\$, etc.) for the resonant \$\Delta^{++}\$ channel across a range of nuclei. The measurements revealed two notable nuclear effects: (1) **Suppression of cross section at low \$Q^2\$ (low four-momentum transfer) in all nuclear targets compared to the GENIE and NuWro predictions**, and (2) **An enhancement of cross section at low pion kinetic energy** relative to simulations. These trends are consistent with strong FSI in the nucleus: low-\$Q^2\$ interactions (forward-going pions) are more likely to undergo absorption or charge exchange, which reduces the observable CC1π rate, while pions that do emerge tend to have lost energy, populating lower kinetic energies. The data show that generators were overpredicting the yield of low-angle, high-energy pions – indicating that they underestimate pion absorption in nuclei.

* **Heavy-vs-Light Target Scaling:** Crucially, MINERvA found that the **per-nucleon CC1π<sup>+</sup> cross sections on heavy targets are significantly lower** than on light targets. For example, at certain kinematics the ratio of cross section per nucleon on Fe to that on CH was only \~0.8, and for Pb to CH as low as \~0.5. This is a dramatic departure from naive scaling (which would expect roughly equal per-nucleon cross sections if nuclear effects were small). None of the standard generators predicted such strong suppression on heavy nuclei. It suggests that pion FSI (absorption) scales faster-than-linearly with \$A\$ – heavier nuclei have a thicker “nuclear medium” that pions must escape, thus a higher chance to be absorbed or inelastically scattered. This result provides direct input to models of pion FSI: for instance, GiBUU and NEUT’s intranuclear cascade can be tuned to reproduce the observed \$A\$-dependence (perhaps by increasing pion mean free path or cross section in nuclear matter).

* **Comparison with Models:** When compared with specific model tunes, the MINERvA CCπ<sup>+</sup> data generally lie below GENIE’s default prediction in normalization (especially for heavy targets) and show shape differences. A few models that include enhancements from 2p2h in the resonant region or use more sophisticated nuclear ground states fare better in shape. No model tested fully captured the simultaneous \$Q^2\$, pion angle, and target dependence of the data. For example, the “Valencia” model with RPA and MEC, as implemented in GENIEv3, improves low-\$Q^2\$ predictions but still misses the magnitude of heavy-target suppression. These data will prompt updated simulation tunes. They are also directly relevant for NOvA and DUNE, where \$\pi^+\$ production on carbon or argon at few-GeV energies is a substantial component of the event sample.

* **Neutral Pion and Antineutrino Channels:** While the above is for \$\pi^+\$ with \$\nu\_\mu\$, MINERvA has also produced results for \$\pi^0\$ and for \$\bar\nu\$-induced pions. For instance, an earlier measurement (2018) of \$\nu\_\mu\$ CC\$\pi^0\$ on CH (Phys. Rev. D 97, 032014) showed similar issues: the need for coherent contributions at very forward angles and deficits in models at certain energies. The most recent \$\pi^+\$ multi-target result complements those by showing the charged-current channel in detail. Additionally, a 2019 result on \$\bar\nu\_\mu\$ CC1π<sup>0</sup> (Phys. Rev. D 100, 052008) provided the first high-stat antineutrino pion data, which highlighted differences in antineutrino vs neutrino cross sections (useful for axial radiation terms in models). All these reinforce a consistent picture: resonant pion production in nuclei is modified by nuclear effects more strongly than many generators assumed, and MINERvA’s rich dataset is now the benchmarking standard.

### Deep Inelastic Scattering (DIS) and Transition Region (MINERvA)

* **Shallow Inelastic (Resonance–DIS Transition) Measurement (2025):** MINERvA has pioneered investigations of the *transition region* between resonant and DIS interactions, often called **Shallow Inelastic Scattering (SIS)**. The latest result (submitted 2025) is the first combined **\$\nu\_\mu\$ and \$\bar\nu\_\mu\$ cross-section measurement in the SIS region** on hydrocarbon. This study explicitly defines SIS as the region of hadronic invariant mass roughly \$W\sim1.4\$–2 GeV, above the \$\Delta(1232)\$ but below where DIS scaling is fully applicable. By selecting events with one or more pions but restricting kinematics (e.g. only one pion at lower energy, or \$W\$ just below 2 GeV), MINERvA measured differential cross sections in variables like the hadronic invariant mass \$W\$, Bjorken-\$x\$, and the outgoing muon kinematics. The results show **significant discrepancies in both shape and normalization between the data and all available neutrino event generators**. In particular, none of GENIE, GiBUU, NEUT, or NuWro could simultaneously match the distributions of \$W\$ and \$x\$ – hinting that the modeling of non-resonant inelastic processes (higher resonance contributions, quark-hadron duality, etc.) is lacking. The data indicate a need for better treatment of *nonresonant pion production off nucleons* within this intermediate region.

* **Key Findings in SIS:** One striking observation is that **the shape of the \$x\$ distribution in data is harder (more high-\$x\$ events) than predicted**, and the overall cross section in 1.5 GeV < \$W\$ < 2 GeV is under-predicted by many models. This could imply that DIS-like processes (scattering off quarks with subsequent hadronization) start contributing at lower \$W\$ than expected, or that the resonance region extends further with significant strength from higher resonances (like \$N^\*\$ states) not fully accounted for in generators. To isolate DIS-like contributions, MINERvA also analyzed a subset of events with hadronic energy >1 GeV (to reduce single-Δ dominance). Even there, models did poorly, suggesting issues in how they extrapolate nucleon structure functions to the few-GeV regime. Overall, MINERvA’s SIS measurement emphasizes that **this region is not well modeled: all tested neutrino generators showed substantial shape and normalization deviations from data.** This has implications for oscillation experiments: DUNE, for example, will have a significant fraction of events in the SIS/DIS regime (around 50% of DUNE’s events will have \$W\$ beyond the Δ resonance). Thus, improving these models (perhaps by incorporating new electron-nucleus data or theoretical advancements in baryon resonance physics) is a high priority.

* **Inclusive DIS and Structure Functions:** At the upper end of its energy range (\~>10 GeV), MINERvA also probed true DIS. While no new peer-reviewed publications as of 2025 were exclusively “DIS cross section” papers, MINERvA did measure inclusive \$\nu\_\mu\$ and \$\bar\nu\_\mu\$ cross sections at high energies that are consistent with existing DIS data. For example, the flux-integrated *inclusive* CC cross section per nucleon on carbon at \$\langle E\_\nu \rangle \sim 9\$ GeV was measured and found to agree with GENIE’s DIS+RES predictions within \~10%. MINERvA has also reported ratios of heavy-to-light target cross sections in the DIS region (analogous to the EMC effect). A noteworthy earlier result showed that the \$\nu\$-Fe/\$\nu\$-C cross section ratio as a function of Bjorken-\$x\$ exhibits an EMC-like suppression at high \$x\$ (\~20% suppression on Fe for \$x\sim0.6\$–0.8). This qualitatively mirrors charged-lepton scattering EMC effects, confirming that nuclear parton distribution effects (shadowing at low \$x\$, EMC suppression at high \$x\$) also appear in neutrino DIS. Such findings, although from earlier runs, remain the latest word on neutrino EMC effect and are consistent with global analyses.

* **Summary of MINERvA DIS Impact:** In sum, MINERvA provided critical data to constrain DIS and transition-region models. The 2025 SIS analysis in particular underscores a “significant gap” in simulations – *none* of the current generators can be used out-of-the-box to reliably predict the 1–3 GeV hadronic mass region. Work is ongoing to incorporate these data into GENIE and NEUT tunes. For oscillation experiments, these improvements will reduce uncertainties in neutrino energy reconstruction (since DIS/SIS feed into how missing energy is modeled). The DIS region also touches on fundamental questions of nucleon structure (axial structure functions, strange quark contributions, etc.), and MINERvA’s data are becoming part of global QCD fits.

### Coherent Pion Production (COH) – Charged and Neutral Current (MINERvA)

* **Multi-Target \$\nu\_\mu\$ Coherent π<sup>+</sup> Production (2023):** MINERvA has produced the most extensive study to date of **coherent charged pion production at multi-GeV energies**. In a 2023 publication (Phys. Rev. Lett. 131, 051801), MINERvA reports measurements of \$\nu\_\mu + A \to \mu^- + \pi^+ + A\$ on four targets simultaneously: CH, C, Fe, and Pb. The neutrino energies span 2–20 GeV (mean \~6 GeV). Several important findings emerged: (1) **The observed coherent π<sup>+</sup> cross sections are higher than predicted by the prevalent Rein-Sehgal (RS) and Berger-Sehgal PCAC models at these energies**. Specifically, at the peak energy \~6 GeV, the measured cross section per nucleus is up to \~50% larger than the default GENIE (RS model) expectation. The discrepancy grows with energy, suggesting the model underestimates the energy dependence of the coherent process. (2) **The nuclear scaling of coherent cross sections is energy-dependent:** at lower energies (\~a few GeV) the cross section scales approximately like \$A^{2/3}\$ (i.e. surface-dominated, as traditional PCAC theory assumes), but at higher energies the effective scaling moves closer to linear (\$\sim A^1\$). In other words, heavy nuclei (Fe, Pb) yield relatively more coherent pions at high energy than expected from a pure surface interaction. MINERvA measured cross-section ratios \$\sigma(\text{Fe})/\sigma(\text{CH})\$ and \$\sigma(\text{Pb})/\sigma(\text{CH})\$; at a few GeV these ratios correspond to an \$A^{0.67}\$ scaling, whereas by \~10–20 GeV they approach \$A^{1.0}\$ scaling. This is a striking indication that **the simple models (which assume coherence only on the nuclear surface) may be missing contributions at higher energy** – possibly due to the longer pion wavelength or different nuclear shadowing effects in the coherent regime.

* **Differential Distributions:** MINERvA’s coherent data also include pion energy and angle distributions for each target. These showed that the pion kinematics generally follow the expected pattern (forward-peaked pions with modest energies). However, the normalization differences imply that perhaps the Rein-Sehgal model’s extrapolation to higher energies is incomplete. Notably, MINERvA’s results favor the updated Berger-Sehgal model (which includes lepton mass terms and uses PCAC with a more realistic form factor) over the older Rein-Sehgal in GENIE. Yet even Berger-Sehgal underpredicts the data at the highest energies measured. This has prompted theorists to revisit the PCAC-based calculations for coherent scattering in the few to tens of GeV range.

* **Comparison with \$\bar\nu\$ and NC:** While MINERvA’s flagship coherent measurement was for \$\nu\_\mu \pi^+\$, the experiment also looked for \$\bar\nu\_\mu \pi^-\$ coherent production and coherent \$\pi^0\$ (neutral current). The \$\bar\nu\_\mu\$ sample was smaller, but indications are that \$\bar\nu\$ coherent cross sections are likewise above predictions. Combined \$\nu\$ and \$\bar\nu\$ data could test the predicted helicity dependence of coherent scattering (which in PCAC gives \$\sigma(\bar\nu)\$ a factor \~\$1/3\$ of \$\sigma(\nu)\$ at equal energy). MINERvA’s \$\pi^0\$ coherent results (earlier publication, PRL 113, 261802 (2014) at low energy, and a higher-energy analysis in progress) show a similar story: measured rates higher than expected at multi-GeV. The **common theme is that current models underestimate coherent production at these energies**, which could affect background predictions for \$\pi^0\$ events in oscillation experiments.

* **Implications for Models:** Coherent pion production depends on the nuclear elastic form factor and meson absorption. MINERvA’s finding of approximate \$A\$-scaling at high energy might hint that *intranuclear absorption is reduced* at high energy (pions traverse the nucleus with less absorption, so more volume contributes coherently). It could also be related to the longitudinal polarization component of the \$W\$ boson (neutrino interactions at higher energy can produce pions via interactions that are not strictly surface-constrained). The data urge revisions to models like GENIE’s treatment of coherence. Practically, these results mean that experiments like NOvA and DUNE might expect slightly more coherent events than previously thought, impacting background estimates for certain event topologies. Already, GENIE and NEUT have begun incorporating MINERvA’s coherent pion data by adjusting the overall normalization and nuclear form factor scale.

In summary, MINERvA’s comprehensive cross-section program has provided critical insights: QE and RES processes are strongly influenced by nuclear effects (RPA, 2p2h, FSI) which must be included to match data, the SIS/DIS region is poorly modeled and needs new attention, and even coherent processes show surprises at multi-GeV scales. Each of these measurements is feeding into improved neutrino interaction models that will benefit current and future oscillation experiments.

## NOvA Experiment (Beam peak ∼2 GeV)

NOvA is a long-baseline oscillation experiment with a 14 mrad off-axis near detector (ND) receiving the NuMI beam peaked around 2 GeV. Although primarily designed for oscillations, the NOvA ND has collected a large sample of neutrino interactions on a hydrocarbon (CH<sub>2</sub>) target at energies 1–6 GeV. In recent years NOvA has started to publish cross-section measurements to improve its interaction model. These measurements often emphasize regions of phase space important to oscillation analyses (e.g. low hadronic energy for quasi-elastic events, or specific channels like \$\pi^0\$ production that can mimic electron neutrinos). Below we summarize NOvA’s latest cross-section results by channel.

### CC Quasi-Elastic and Low Hadronic Energy (NOvA)

&#x20;*NOvA measurement of the **inclusive CC cross section vs “available energy”** (\$E\_{\text{avail}}\$, energy of final-state hadrons above nuclear binding) in \$\nu\_\mu\$–CH interactions (black points). Curves show GENIE-based predictions with various treatments of 2p2h (multinucleon) processes. The NOvA-tuned GENIE 2.12 (red solid) includes an empirical 2p2h model tuned to data; other models shown are GENIE empirical 2p2h (red dashed), MINERvA 2p2h tune (blue dotted), SuSAv2 (green dash-dot), and Valencia (blue solid). The NOvA data exhibit an excess in the 2p2h-dominated region (peak around 0.3 GeV of available energy) relative to the Valencia model, indicating the need for enhanced 2p2h strength.*

* **Double-Differential \$\nu\_\mu\$ CC at Low Hadronic Energy (2024):** NOvA’s most recent QE-oriented result is a measurement of **\$\nu\_\mu\$ CC cross sections with low hadronic energy** in the final state (published 2024). This analysis selects events where no proton above 250 MeV kinetic energy and no pion above 175 MeV kinetic are present – i.e. predominantly CC0π0p events (CCQE-like or with only invisible nucleon activity). By restricting to low hadronic recoil, the sample is enriched in true CCQE and 2p2h interactions. NOvA reported the cross section in this topology as a function of the muon angle and momentum (double-differential), as well as single-differential vs \$Q^2\_{\text{QE}}\$ (quasi-elastic kinematic estimate of \$Q^2\$). The results show notable **disagreements with current models in certain regions**: for instance, **in the forward-muon (small angle) region, the data lie significantly below the model predictions**. This forward-muon region corresponds to high neutrino energy transfer with the muon carrying most energy (hence low hadronic energy) – precisely where long-range correlations (RPA) suppress the QE cross section in nuclear targets. The observed deficit suggests that generators might be missing strength in other channels or overestimating QE at low \$Q^2\$. Conversely, at larger muon angles (higher \$Q^2\$), some models underpredict the data. NOvA’s analysis explicitly finds “strong disagreement between data and theory-based models in various regions of muon kinematics”, especially at **low \$Q^2\$** where RPA and 2p2h are relevant. This is consistent with findings by T2K and MINERvA that tuning of RPA and 2p2h is needed; the NOvA data provides a new testing ground at \$E\_\nu \sim2\$ GeV.

* **Inclusive CC Cross Section and 2p2h Identification:** Another NOvA result (2024) measured the **inclusive \$\nu\_\mu\$ CC cross section** in a 2D space of momentum transfer (\$|{\bf q}|\$) and “available energy” (\$E\_{\text{avail}}\$, energy deposited by hadrons excluding nuclear breakup energy). By examining the distribution of events in \$E\_{\text{avail}}\$, NOvA could isolate the contribution of multinucleon (2p2h) processes: an excess of events at moderate \$E\_{\text{avail}} \sim 0.3\$–0.5 GeV (above what pure QE+RES models give) is attributed to 2p2h interactions. Indeed, NOvA observed a **clear excess in the cross section relative to GENIE’s base QE+RES prediction in the region associated with 2p2h**. They compared the data to several 2p2h models (Valencia, SuSAv2, an empirical MINERvA-tuned MEC, etc.) as shown in the figure above. While all 2p2h implementations improved agreement, none perfectly matched the shape and magnitude of the excess. Quantitatively, NOvA found that the default GENIE empirical 2p2h model and the MINERvA 2p2h tune both slightly underpredict the strength of the multi-nucleon component, whereas the Valencia model (as implemented) gave a somewhat different shape of missing energy than observed. NOvA assessed model performance via \$\chi^2\$ and concluded that **some 2p2h models (e.g. Valencia, SuSAv2) fall short in describing the measured cross-section subdomain attributed to 2p2h**. This is in line with MINERvA’s findings at higher energies. Thanks to NOvA’s relatively high-statistics sample (\~10<sup>6</sup> events), these differences are statistically significant. The practical upshot: NOvA’s data support the inclusion of an enhanced 2p2h component in simulations (the NOvA collaboration has developed a tune v1.2 shown in the figure, which improves agreement). This helps reduce bias in neutrino energy reconstruction for QE-like events.

* **Cross-Section Magnitudes:** NOvA reported the total \$\nu\_\mu\$ CC cross section in the restricted low-hadronic-energy topology. Integrating their double-differential result yields an energy-integrated cross section (for \$E\_\nu\$ roughly 1–3 GeV, limited phase space) of order \$10^{-38}\$ cm² per nucleon. In comparisons, the data were generally within 10–20% of the GENIE expectation, but with the shape disagreements noted. The inclusive measurement found the total CC cross section at \$\langle E\_\nu \rangle=1.86\$ GeV to be \$\approx\$ \$6.8 \times 10^{-39}\$ cm² per nucleon (for \$E\_\nu>1\$ GeV), in line with world data. However, in the **2p2h-enhanced subdomain**, the measured cross section was higher than models by up to 15–20%. This serves as a quantitative constraint to tune the overall 2p2h normalizations in GENIE/NEUT for \~2 GeV neutrinos.

* **Relevance to Oscillations:** These NOvA QE-like results are extremely pertinent to NOvA’s oscillation analyses. Uncertainties in 2p2h and nuclear suppression (RPA) directly affect how NOvA predicts the energy of events in the far detector (where CC0π interactions are dominant for the \$\nu\_\mu\$ disappearance channel). By measuring these cross sections in the near detector, NOvA can constrain its interaction model and reduce systematic uncertainties in oscillation fits. Indeed, NOvA has incorporated the cross-section data into its latest oscillation analyses, leading to improved agreement between near and far spectrum predictions (reducing the so-called “cross-section model” systematics).

In summary, **NOvA’s CCQE-like measurements confirm and extend the picture from T2K/MINERvA**: a need for robust modeling of RPA suppression at low \$Q^2\$ (to explain deficits at forward angles) and a need for sufficient 2p2h strength (to explain the excess at moderate missing energy). The data are a valuable addition, being at intermediate energy (\~2 GeV) and on a medium-heavy nucleus (CH<sub>2</sub>) – they provide a bridge between T2K and MINERvA regimes.

### Resonant and Single-Pion Production (NOvA)

* **CC π<sup>0</sup> Production (2023):** NOvA has released a new measurement of **inclusive \$\nu\_\mu\$ charged-current π<sup>0</sup> production** in the near detector. This channel (where a \$\pi^0\$ is produced alongside a muon) is of interest because \$\pi^0\$ decays to photons which can mimic electron neutrino signals. NOvA’s measurement used 8.02×10<sup>20</sup> POT exposure and collected \~165k events with a \$\pi^0\$ identified. The flux-averaged total cross section for \$\nu\_\mu A \to \mu^- \pi^0 X\$ (with \$E\_\nu\$ from 1 to 5 GeV on CH$\_2\$) was measured to be **\$(3.57 \pm 0.44) \times 10^{-39}\$ cm²**. This is about 7.5% higher than the prediction of NOvA’s reference GENIE (which gave \$\approx 3.32 \times 10^{-39}\$ cm² for the same energy range). However, the difference is within the uncertainties, so NOvA reported the result as *consistent with GENIE within errors*. Differential cross sections were also provided: NOvA unfolded the distributions in muon momentum, muon angle, \$\pi^0\$ momentum, \$\pi^0\$ angle, \$Q^2\$, and the hadronic invariant mass \$W\$. In general, GENIE’s shape predictions agreed reasonably well with the data, except some slight deviations at low \$\pi^0\$ angles and low \$Q^2\$.

* **Physics Implications:** The NOvA \$\pi^0\$ result is important as it validates the resonant and coherent π^0 production models in GENIE at \~2 GeV. The total cross section being only mildly higher than GENIE indicates no large unmodeled component (e.g., no mystery excess of π^0 events). This is reassuring since past experiments (like MiniBooNE) saw shape discrepancies in CCπ^0 which led to model tuning. The NOvA data suggest that a tuned GENIE (with e.g. Valencia 2p2h and other adjustments) can already reproduce π^0 production at the \~10% level. One specific check was coherent π^0: in the NOvA sample, a small fraction of events would be CC coherent π^0 on carbon. GENIE’s default had a tiny contribution (\~1-2%). If this were significantly under- or over-estimated, it could show up in the angular distribution (coherent π^0 are extremely forward). NOvA’s differential cross section \$d\sigma/d\cos\theta\_{\pi}\$ did not show an unexplained excess at \$\cos\theta \approx 1\$, implying the coherent contribution at 2 GeV is indeed small (consistent with model). This helps confirm the understanding of NC and CC coherent backgrounds for long-baseline \$\nu\_e\$ appearance.

* **Model Comparisons:** When comparing to alternative models, NOvA found that the data lies within the spread of predictions from different tunes. For instance, GiBUU and NEUT predictions (not explicitly quoted in the paper, but inferred) differ by \~10–20% in normalization; the NOvA result would likely sit in between. The \$W\$ distribution (invariant mass of hadronic system) peaks around the \$\Delta(1232)\$ resonance as expected, and NOvA’s data help constrain the non-resonant background under that peak. The agreement with GENIE suggests that the tuned single-pion production (including non-resonant amplitudes up to \$W\sim1.8\$ GeV that GENIE includes) is reasonably good. That said, given MINERvA’s findings of suppression on heavier nuclei, one might expect NOvA’s data (on CH$\_2\$) to also show some nuclear effects. If NOvA’s sample is mostly on carbon (with hydrogen a small fraction providing essentially free nucleon interactions), the result being slightly above GENIE might hint that GENIE’s nuclear absorption is a bit too strong for carbon at 2 GeV (hence data > MC). But the difference is not significant enough to draw firm conclusions. More detailed differential comparisons (e.g. \$d\sigma/dQ^2\$) will allow NOvA to tune its model — the paper noted that the shape of the \$Q^2\$ distribution is slightly different from GENIE, which could be due to missing 2p2h in the pion sample or inaccuracies in form factors.

* **Antineutrino and NC Channels:** NOvA has not yet published a \$\bar\nu\_\mu\$ single-pion cross section or NC π^0 cross section. However, ongoing analyses in NOvA are expected, given their importance for oscillation backgrounds. The techniques developed in the \$\nu\_\mu\$ CCπ^0 analysis pave the way for those. When those results come, comparisons to MINERvA’s antineutrino pion data will be valuable (MINERvA observed differences in \$\bar\nu\$ vs \$\nu\$ pion rates that test the axial vector form factors in the resonance region).

In summary, **NOvA’s resonant pion measurement confirms the validity of resonance production modeling at 2 GeV within \~10%**. It provides one of the few modern \$\pi^0\$ cross section datasets and thus is a critical input for refining interaction uncertainties on that channel in NOvA’s oscillation analysis (and a useful cross-check for T2K which has mostly \$\pi^+\$ data). The mild excess over GENIE may hint at slight tweaks needed (perhaps in pion FSI or 2p2h contributions), consistent with the direction indicated by MINERvA’s heavier target data.

### Deep Inelastic Scattering (DIS) and High-Energy Interactions (NOvA)

* **Inclusive Cross Sections up to 6 GeV:** NOvA’s beam provides neutrinos up to \~6 GeV, which begins to enter the DIS regime (multi-pion states, excitation of nucleon resonances beyond Δ). While NOvA has not isolated a pure DIS sample, its **inclusive measurements** inherently include all interaction types, DIS included. The 2D measurement of \$d^2\sigma/d|q|dE\_{\text{avail}}\$ mentioned earlier spans kinematics up to \$|q|=2\$ GeV/c and \$E\_{\text{avail}}=2\$ GeV. The high \$|q|\$ and high available-energy corner of that phase space corresponds to DIS events (multiple hadrons, higher \$W\$). NOvA noted that even after accounting for 2p2h, some discrepancies remain in that region. For example, at \$|q| \sim 1.5\$–2 GeV/c and \$E\_{\text{avail}}\sim 0.8\$–1.0 GeV, the data have a slight excess which could hint at deficiencies in the DIS/transition region modeling. However, given the focus on low hadronic energy, NOvA’s analyses so far have not explicitly extracted DIS structure functions or cross sections.

* **Comparison to Models at High \$W\$:** The NOvA inclusive data were compared to GENIE with different *tunes*, including ones with alternate DIS models (like a version of GENIE with Berger-Sehgal and improved hadronization). The differences between tunes were mostly within uncertainties of the current data. NOvA did not find a glaring need to modify DIS normalization – the inclusive cross section at 6 GeV is in line with historical measurements (e.g. NOMAD, MINOS). This suggests that GENIE’s overall DIS cross section (dominated by QCD parton model) is reasonably accurate. The subtler issues may lie in the transition region (as highlighted by MINERvA). For NOvA, many of those transition events are categorized as “RES” in GENIE. The collaboration is aware that some of these could actually be DIS-like. In oscillation fits, they treat uncertainties in the RES/DIS mix.

* **Outlook and DUNE Connection:** The NOvA data in the DIS regime are limited by statistics and energy reach. DUNE’s ND will cover higher energies and likely produce dedicated DIS measurements. However, NOvA’s contributions are still useful: they show that at 2–4 GeV, the inclusive cross section doesn’t hide any massive unknowns (no factor-of-two mismatches; discrepancies are at the tens of percent level in certain kinematic corners). They also provide an opportunity to test whether modifications like transverse momentum imbalance (used at T2K for CCQE) could be extended to DIS events (e.g. requiring multi-hadron final states and looking at momentum imbalance could isolate nuclear hadronization effects).

* **Electron Neutrino Cross Section:** One notable NOvA result in the DIS/inclusive category is the **\$\nu\_e\$ CC inclusive cross section** measurement (published 2022). NOvA leveraged its large \$\nu\_e\$ appearance sample in the ND to measure \$\nu\_e + \text{CH}*2\$ cross sections in the 1–6 GeV range. This is effectively an inclusive cross section (sums over QE, RES, DIS for \$\nu\_e\$). They reported double-differential \$d^2\sigma/(dE\_e d\cos\theta\_e)\$ and single-differential \$d\sigma/dQ^2\$ for electron neutrinos. This was the first such measurement and is important because \$\nu\_e\$ cross sections have slight differences from \$\nu*\mu\$ (due to radiative corrections and nuclear ejection differences). NOvA’s \$\nu\_e\$ cross section results were consistent with GENIE and other generators (within \~15%), though with somewhat larger uncertainties (\~17% systematic uncertainty, dominated by flux). This confirmation that \$\nu\_e\$ interactions at a few GeV behave as expected gives confidence that no unexpected “species dependence” (apart from well-understood radiative effects) is present. In model terms, it supports lepton universality in neutrino interactions – a crucial assumption when applying \$\nu\_\mu\$ tuned models to \$\nu\_e\$ appearance predictions.

In summary, **NOvA’s foray into cross-section measurements** has provided targeted insights: a validation of inclusive and electron-neutrino cross sections, and new constraints on multinucleon and resonant pion processes at its energies. While NOvA’s energy reach for DIS is limited, its data did not reveal large anomalies, reinforcing the continuity between MINERvA’s higher-energy findings and T2K’s lower-energy ones. All three experiments together paint a coherent picture: neutrino interaction models are generally able to reproduce total cross sections to \~10–20%, but **model deficiencies appear in specific niches** – low-\$Q^2\$ QE, multinucleon enhancement, nuclear-dependent pion absorption, and the resonance–DIS transition region – which are being actively addressed with the help of these precise new measurements.
