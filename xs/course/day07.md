# **Day 7: Historical and Modern Neutrino Cross-Section Experiments**

---

## **1. Introduction**

Over the past 50 years, our knowledge of neutrino cross sections has been built through a sequence of experimental efforts using increasingly sophisticated detectors and beams. This lecture surveys the evolution of neutrino cross-section measurements and emphasizes lessons learned and challenges ahead.

Goals:

* Understand how early experiments shaped our knowledge of QE, RES, and DIS processes.
* Survey major modern cross-section experiments and their contributions.
* Appreciate the importance of target material, flux knowledge, and detector capabilities.
* Discuss the role of cross-section measurements in the context of oscillation programs.

## **2. Early Experiments: Hydrogen and Deuterium Targets**

### 2.1 Bubble Chamber Era (1960s–1980s)

Experiments: ANL, BNL, Gargamelle, BEBC, SKAT.

* Used **hydrogen ($H_2$)** or **deuterium ($D_2$)** bubble chambers.
* Targets: effectively free nucleons → no nuclear effects.
* Visual reconstruction of tracks and interaction vertices.

Key contributions:

* First measurements of CCQE and single pion production.
* Determination of the axial mass $M_A \sim 1.0 \, \text{GeV}$.
* Establishment of basic cross-section behavior vs energy.

Limitations:

* Low statistics,
* Coarse energy resolution,
* No access to nuclear targets.

---

## **3. Transition to Nuclear Targets (1980s–2000s)**

As neutrino beam intensities increased and oscillation physics gained attention, experiments began using **heavier nuclear targets** for higher event rates.

Notable efforts:

* **CCFR/NuTeV**: neutrino-iron DIS cross sections; structure functions.
* **CDHSW**: early inclusive CC measurements on iron.
* **NOMAD** (CERN): high-resolution tracking with composite target (C, Fe, Al).
* **CHORUS**: emulsion-based, focused on tau neutrinos but also cross-section data.

These experiments:

* Provided high-statistics DIS data.
* Contributed to PDF fits and structure function measurements.
* Lacked ability to resolve exclusive final states (e.g., protons, pions).

## **4. The MiniBooNE Revolution**

### 4.1 MiniBooNE (Fermilab, 2003–2019)

* Target: CH$_2$ (mineral oil),
* Energy: peak $E_\nu \sim 0.8 \, \text{GeV}$,
* Detector: spherical Cherenkov detector (no tracking).

Findings:

* Measured CCQE cross section significantly larger than predictions using $M_A = 1.0 \, \text{GeV}$,
* Required $M_A \sim 1.3 \, \text{GeV}$ to fit data → prompted reevaluation of nuclear models.

Implications:

* Introduced the need to consider 2p2h/multi-nucleon effects,
* Demonstrated importance of defining cross sections in terms of final-state particles (e.g., “CC0π”).

---

## **5. Dedicated Cross-Section Programs**

### 5.1 SciBooNE

* Follow-up to MiniBooNE,
* Fine-grained scintillator detector,
* Improved tracking and vertex resolution,
* Measured CCQE, CC1π, NC elastic, and coherent pion production on carbon.

---

### 5.2 MINERvA

* **Dedicated cross-section experiment** at Fermilab,
* Targets: plastic (CH), C, Fe, Pb, He, H$_2$O,
* Energy: 1–20 GeV from NuMI beam.

Key achievements:

* Systematic study of nuclear effects across targets,
* Precision measurements of CCQE, CCπ, DIS, and 2p2h-sensitive observables,
* Input to generator tuning (GENIE, NuWro),
* Studies of transverse kinematic imbalance (TKI) to probe nuclear dynamics.

---

### 5.3 ArgoNeuT

* First LAr TPC operated in a beamline (NuMI),
* Target: $^{40}$Ar,
* Demonstrated feasibility of LAr for exclusive cross-section measurements.

Results:

* CCQE, CC1π on argon at few-GeV energies,
* Proton multiplicity distributions,
* Foundation for future argon-based programs.

---

## **6. Cross-Section Measurements in Oscillation Experiments**

### 6.1 T2K Near Detector (ND280)

* Modular detector with magnetized TPCs and fine-grained scintillators,
* Targets: CH and water,
* Energy: narrow-band beam at $\sim 0.6 \, \text{GeV}$.

Accomplishments:

* Precise differential cross sections for CC0π and CC1π,
* Cross-section ratios (e.g., water vs carbon),
* Generator tuning and neutrino flux constraints.

---

### 6.2 MicroBooNE

* LAr TPC at Fermilab, same beamline as MiniBooNE,
* Energy: $\sim 0.8 \, \text{GeV}$.

Key studies:

* CC inclusive and CC0π cross sections on argon,
* Proton and neutron multiplicity measurements,
* Final-state kinematic correlations,
* Validation of GENIE’s argon modeling.

---

## **7. Measurement Strategies and Observables**

### 7.1 Inclusive Cross Sections

* All CC interactions (regardless of final state),
* Used for flux normalization and overall interaction rate benchmarking.

### 7.2 Exclusive Channels

* Defined by number/type of final-state particles:

  * CC0π: muon only (QE-like),
  * CC1π⁺: muon + 1 π⁺ (RES-like),
  * NCπ⁰: important background for νₑ appearance.

### 7.3 Differential Measurements

* $\frac{d\sigma}{dT_\mu}$, $\frac{d\sigma}{dQ^2}$, etc.,
* Often presented **flux-integrated** to avoid model bias,
* Recent focus on multi-differential (e.g., $\frac{d^2\sigma}{dT_\mu d\cos\theta_\mu}$).

---

## **8. Role of Target Material**

* Different nuclei introduce distinct nuclear effects.
* Comparison between targets (C, O, Ar, Fe, Pb) reveals:

  * Scaling behavior,
  * Onset of shadowing and Fermi motion,
  * Neutron/proton content dependence.

Experiments like MINERvA exploit multiple targets to isolate these effects.

---

## **9. Flux Uncertainties and In Situ Techniques**

### 9.1 Flux Normalization

* Often largest systematic in cross-section measurements,
* Methods to constrain:

  * Hadron production data (e.g., NA61/SHINE),
  * Neutrino-electron elastic scattering,
  * Low-$\nu$ method (based on flat cross section at low hadronic energy).

---

## **10. Summary and Takeaways**

* Cross-section measurements have evolved from simple hydrogen-based studies to complex multi-nuclear comparisons.
* Modern experiments balance high-statistics, multi-dimensional measurements with careful attention to nuclear effects and flux uncertainties.
* These measurements feed into improved models, better generator tuning, and reduced systematic errors in oscillation analyses.
* Future measurements will continue to refine our understanding, especially on argon for DUNE.
