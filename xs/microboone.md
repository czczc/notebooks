# Summary of MicroBooNE Neutrino Cross-Section Results (up to 2025)

## Charged-Current Inclusive Cross Sections (ν<sub>μ</sub>-Ar)

**Measurements:** MicroBooNE has measured **flux-averaged inclusive** ν<sub>μ</sub>-argon charged-current (CC) cross sections in multiple differential formats. The first result (2019) provided double-differential cross sections as a function of muon kinematics (momentum and angle). In 2022, MicroBooNE reported the **energy-dependent CC inclusive** cross section on argon, unfolding the data to neutrino energy – a first on argon. By 2023, a triple-differential (3D) measurement probed joint distributions of leptonic and hadronic variables, giving a comprehensive test of generator models.

**Key Results & Uncertainties:** The inclusive CC cross section at MicroBooNE’s mean E<sub>ν</sub>≈0.8 GeV was measured to be on the order of 10<sup>−38</sup> cm² per argon nucleon (integrated over the BNB flux), with differential shapes reported in bins of muon momentum (p<sub>μ</sub>) and angle. Statistical uncertainties are small due to large event samples, while systematics (\~10–20%) are dominated by neutrino flux normalization and detector effects. The data show a characteristic fall-off at high muon momentum (forward angles) and an enhanced cross section in low-momentum (large angle) bins compared to simple quasielastic predictions. Importantly, **MicroBooNE’s inclusive data strongly disfavors the GENIE v2 generator with no nuclear medium corrections** – that model **over-predicts** the cross section at low momentum transfer. In contrast, **GENIE v3 (with updated nuclear physics)** and similar modern generators (NuWro, GiBUU) agree much better with the measured distributions. The inclusion of *Random Phase Approximation* (RPA) corrections and multi-nucleon (2p2h) processes in GENIE v3 leads to a much improved χ² (e.g. χ²/ndf ≈ 2.47 for GENIE v2 vs ≈ 1.0 for GENIE v3 in one analysis). This indicates **suppression of low-\$Q^2\$ cross section by RPA and addition of 2p2h strength are required** to match argon data. MicroBooNE’s 2022 energy-dependent analysis further showed that a *MicroBooNE-tuned GENIE* prediction (see **Model Updates** below) matched the measured σ(E) spectrum better than the GENIE default: the untuned GENIE v3 and NuWro central predictions were statistically **disfavored** compared to the tuned model. Overall, after accounting for systematic uncertainties, **no large normalization discrepancy** was observed – the data sit within \~1σ of GENIE v3’s total cross section normalization – but the **shape** information has been crucial for model discrimination.

**Comparison to Other Experiments:** These findings are **consistent with observations by T2K and MINERvA**, albeit on different nuclear targets. T2K’s CC inclusive and CC0π data on carbon also required RPA screening of the quasielastic peak and inclusion of 2p2h interactions to fit the muon spectra, prompting similar model tunes in NEUT (T2K’s generator). MINERvA, at higher beam energies (\~3–5 GeV on CH), observed an excess of events at low momentum transfer (“low recoil”) that was not explained by GENIE’s Fermi Gas + QE alone – pointing to the same multi-nucleon enhancement MicroBooNE sees at 0.8 GeV. After incorporating Valencia 2p2h and nuclear screening, MINERvA achieved good agreement, mirroring MicroBooNE’s experience. NOvA’s near detector (mostly carbon, E<sub>ν</sub>\~2 GeV) employs GENIE tuned with similar nuclear parameters; its inclusive rates have generally agreed with expectations once these tuned models (informed by MINERvA/T2K) are used, showing no significant tension with MicroBooNE’s argon results. In summary, MicroBooNE’s inclusive measurements reinforce a **coherent picture across experiments:** all require sizable nuclear-medium effects (RPA, 2p2h) to reconcile neutrino–nucleus cross sections with data. MicroBooNE’s contribution is unique in testing these effects on a heavy target (Ar), where such nuclear corrections are even more pronounced (heavy nuclei amplify RPA suppression).

## Charged-Current Quasi-Elastic (CCQE) and 0π Channels

**Measurements:** MicroBooNE has devoted special attention to **CC0π (quasi-elastic–like)** interactions, i.e. CC events with no pions in the final state. The **“CCQE-like” topology**, typically one muon plus nucleons, dominates at BNB energies. In 2020 MicroBooNE published the first differential cross sections for **1μ1p final states on argon**, selecting events with one muon and one proton (no mesons) as a clean quasielastic sample. This was reported in both single-differential form and as a function of reconstructed energy transfer, etc.. By 2023, this analysis was extended to **multi-differential distributions** (simultaneously in muon kinematics and proton kinematics) for quasielastic-like events, providing even tighter constraints on nuclear models. MicroBooNE also measured the cross section for events with \*\*one muon and **two protons** (CC2p, no pions) – a topology indicative of 2p2h interactions – marking the first such exclusive 2-proton cross-section result on argon. These CCQE/0π measurements typically have \~20–30% systematic uncertainties (flux and detector modeling dominate), with statistics sufficient to bin in multiple kinematic variables.

**Key Results:** The **CCQE-like cross sections** on Ar generally show good agreement in absolute scale with GENIE and other generators **once nuclear effects are included**. MicroBooNE’s **1μ1p** data were found to be **consistent with GENIE v3’s prediction within uncertainties** across most kinematic ranges. In particular, the flux-averaged single-differential cross sections (e.g. vs. muon momentum or proton kinetic energy) largely fall in line with GENIE’s Valencia-model CCQE + 2p2h calculation (with tuned parameters), confirming that argon does not drastically deviate from expectations drawn from lighter nuclei. **However, small but notable discrepancies appear at low momentum transfer:** MicroBooNE observed an **excess of data at very forward muon angles (low \$q^2\$)** compared to the model. This suggests GENIE (even with RPA) may **over-suppress** the cross section in the most Pauli-blocked region or that additional reaction strength (e.g. 2p2h at low energy transfer) might be needed. The published statement was that data are in *“good agreement with GENIE predictions, except at small muon scattering angles corresponding to low momentum-transfer reactions”*, which **highlights a kinematic regime where model improvement is needed**. The multi-differential analysis echoed this: GENIE v3 achieved χ²/ndf \~1 when all phase space is considered, outperforming older models, but differences remained in the lowest-\$q\_0\$ bins. On the other hand, the **overall normalization** of the CCQE-like cross section on Ar (for 1μ1p events) was confirmed – MicroBooNE’s flux-averaged σ<sub>CC0π,Ar</sub> is consistent with scaling expectations from e.g. T2K’s σ<sub>CC0π,C</sub>. This provides a valuable confirmation for neutrino oscillation experiments that rely on CCQE cross-section modeling on argon.

MicroBooNE’s exclusive **CC2p (two-proton) cross section** result (2023) directly probes multi-nucleon processes. While detailed results are forthcoming (at the time of writing), early indications show that events with two energetic protons are observed at rates comparable to model predictions, suggesting GENIE’s 2p2h implementation (tuned to lower-A data) is in the right ballpark. This measurement will further constrain the 2p2h normalization on argon. Likewise, MicroBooNE reported **differential cross sections split by proton multiplicity** (see next section), which revealed that **events with no proton above detection threshold are more common than some models anticipated** – hinting that nuclear FSI or 2p2h effects redistribute strength into “0p” final states.

**GENIE Comparison & Tuning:** The CCQE sector is where MicroBooNE data have driven major GENIE model updates. The default GENIE v2 (no RPA, empirical MEC) gave a poor match: for instance, a GENIE v2.12 prediction with an empirical MEC addon was *“strongly disfavored”* by the 2019 data (χ² per bin roughly double that of newer models). The **GENIE v3.0.6 model (with Valencia QE and 2p2h, and RPA screening)** provided a much better fit, yielding the lowest χ² in MicroBooNE’s CC0π distributions. Specifically, GENIE v3’s inclusion of **RPA (which reduces the cross section at low momentum transfer) and a tuned 2p2h strength** aligned the prediction with MicroBooNE’s suppressed low-\$p\_μ\$ yield. MicroBooNE noted that these nuclear effects “have the largest impact at low energies and for heavy targets, which explains why MicroBooNE is more sensitive to these effects than previous experiments”. Indeed, argon’s high \$A\$ amplifies the RPA reduction at low \$Q^2\$. After adopting GENIE v3 with these features, **the remaining CCQE-like data vs. model differences are modest** (within systematic errors) aside from the low-angle region. This agreement validated GENIE’s new nuclear models on a heavy nucleus. It also motivated a refined **GENIE tune (the “MicroBooNE tune”)** focusing on CC0π interactions – described in more detail under **Model Updates**. In summary, MicroBooNE’s CCQE results confirmed the adequacy of the Valencia QE and MEC models (with certain parameter tweaks) for argon, and pinpointed phase-space corners (e.g. very low momentum transfer) where GENIE may require further improvement.

**Comparison to T2K, MINERvA, NOvA:** MicroBooNE’s CCQE-like findings broadly **mirror those from T2K (C, O targets)** – T2K observed that without RPA, generators over-predict the cross section at low \$Q^2\$ on carbon; their data forced the inclusion of RPA and a tuned axial mass in NEUT, just as MicroBooNE’s did for GENIE. T2K’s measured CC0π cross sections (e.g. Phys. Rev. D 93 (2016) 112012) are in absolute agreement with GENIE’s post-RPA predictions, akin to MicroBooNE’s agreement on Ar. **MINERvA** (CH target) measured CCQE at higher energies and found that a tuned GENIE with RPA+MEC was required to reconcile shape discrepancies – in particular, MINERvA saw that GENIE v2 without 2p2h underpredicted the **high-\$p\_\mu\$ (low-recoil)** part of the QE-like spectrum, an effect that the addition of multi-nucleon correlations corrected. MicroBooNE’s lower-energy data, dominated by QE and 2p2h, are complementary: they directly observed the need for those same 2p2h contributions, lending weight to MINERvA’s conclusions across a very different energy regime. **NOvA** has not published exclusive 1μ1p cross sections, but its simulation studies indicate that an untuned GENIE v2 would similarly mis-model the \$Q^2\$ distribution – hence NOvA’s analyses now use tuned generators (incorporating T2K/MINERvA inputs) that MicroBooNE’s results support. In short, **there is a cross-experimental consensus on CCQE modeling**: a mildly modified Valencia QE (with an effective axial mass M<sub>A</sub>≈1.0–1.1 GeV and RPA suppression) plus a 2p2h component yields agreement with data from \$^{12}\$C to \$^{40}\$Ar. MicroBooNE’s argon data provided a crucial high-A confirmation of these model ingredients.

## Nuclear Effects: Proton Multiplicity (0p vs 1p) and FSI Insights

MicroBooNE has uniquely explored how **hadronic final-state interactions (FSI) and multi-nucleon processes** affect the observable final-state proton content in CC events. In 2024, the collaboration reported the **first simultaneous measurement of CC cross sections on argon split by proton multiplicity** – comparing events with **no protons (0p)** to those with **≥1 proton (Np)** in the final state. This analysis measured differential cross sections vs. proton kinetic energy, where the lowest bin (\$T\_p<35\$ MeV) effectively corresponds to the 0p channel (no reconstructable proton). The aim was to isolate how often neutrino interactions leave *no* visible proton, which is sensitive to nuclear dynamics (e.g. FSI absorption of protons, or interactions on neutrons yielding neutral knockouts).

**Key Findings:** A striking observation is that **event generators struggled in the 0p channel**. The data revealed a significant cross section for 0p final states (a sharp peak at very low proton energy) that most models **under-predicted**. Quantitatively, all generators except GiBUU showed a **deficit of 0p events**: GENIE, NuWro, and NEUT each predicted too few CC interactions with no outgoing proton above threshold. For example, NEUT’s default prediction for the 0p cross section was well below the measured value (contributing to a high χ² in that channel). **GiBUU**, on the other hand, was able to reproduce the 0p yield more accurately. The **reason** traces back to FSI modeling: GiBUU’s transport model treats nucleon FSI with a realistic potential and continuous interactions, causing many low-energy protons to be reabsorbed or slowed such that they don’t emerge – which aligns with MicroBooNE’s 0p data. In contrast, GENIE and NEUT use parametric intranuclear cascades (e.g. GENIE’s hA2018 model) that may **underestimate the removal of very low-energy protons**, leading to an overprediction of events with at least one proton. NEUT’s treatment, for instance, imposes an effective energy threshold for FSI (nucleons below \~2×m<sub>n</sub> energy not reinteracted), which **“reduces the strength of FSI for low-energy nucleons, leading to a sharp drop-off in the cross section at low \$T\_p\$ and a low 0p prediction”** inconsistent with data. MicroBooNE finds that this is exactly where NEUT (and similarly GENIE) fall short, whereas GiBUU – which does not impose such a cut – **mirrors the sharp peak in 0p events observed in data**.

This has important modeling implications: it suggests that **Argon data favor a more aggressive FSI effect on outgoing protons**, meaning many protons are either stuck in the nucleus or below detection threshold, contributing to 0p final states. The MicroBooNE analysis indeed concludes that **generators can describe inclusive (all-proton) cross sections well, yet still mis-model the hadronic composition**. For instance, a model might get the total CC rate right but incorrectly partition it between 0p and 1p events. The data show NEUT did OK on the inclusive spectrum but not on the split channels, due to its FSI approach. GENIE’s default cascade also *underpredicted 0p events* (though GENIE fared a bit better than NEUT in moderate-\$T\_p\$ region). The **MicroBooNE tune (GENIE v3) was also tested**: it improved moderate-to-high \$T\_p\$ predictions, but like NEUT, it didn’t fully cure the low-\$T\_p\$ deficit – indicating the tune didn’t alter FSI. Only GiBUU’s all-nucleon FSI transport reproduced the 0p rate, giving it the lowest χ² overall despite slightly undershooting some higher-\$T\_p\$ bins.

**Model Impact:** These results suggest that **GENIE (and NEUT) may need to refine FSI parameters for nucleon reinteraction**. A possible remedy is to implement a more realistic nuclear potential or allow more re-scattering for sub-threshold protons, as GiBUU does. MicroBooNE’s data lend credence to the idea that protons often lose energy in Argon and fail to exit – something GENIE’s hA cascade might be too optimistic about. Indeed, the collaboration noted that GiBUU’s self-consistent treatment of “target” and “ejected” nucleons in FSI could be key to capturing the 0p excess. They also reference complementary MicroBooNE measurements of **transverse kinematic imbalance (TKI)** in neutrino-Ar interactions (an analysis using imbalance between muon and proton momentum to probe FSI and 2p2h). Those TKI studies (and earlier argon data on multiplicity distributions) also indicate that FSI can create imbalance and lead to undetected nucleons, reinforcing the 0p observation. Taken together, **MicroBooNE has provided direct evidence that FSI modeling in generators should be revisited for argon** – potentially by incorporating models that treat low-energy nucleon interactions more thoroughly. This insight will influence GENIE’s future tunes for DUNE-era physics, ensuring that the fraction of CCQE events with no proton is accurately predicted.

**Comparisons:** Other experiments haven’t explicitly published 0p vs 1p cross-section splits on heavy nuclei – MicroBooNE’s LArTPC technology and reconstruction of low-energy protons made this possible. However, **indirect support comes from T2K**: T2K’s CC0π analyses on carbon showed some model mismatches in distributions sensitive to FSI (e.g. proton spectra, knockout neutron rates), which improved when using GiBUU-based models or enhanced FSI in NEUT. MINERvA also measured final-state proton multiplicities in ν–CH interactions (Phys. Rev. D 101 (2020) 092001) and found that GENIE’s FSI overpredicted events with protons above 120 MeV/c, hinting at missing 0p strength – a trend consistent with MicroBooNE’s findings on Ar. Thus, while MicroBooNE is the first to *quantify* the 0p cross section on argon, the result is **complementary to MINERvA and T2K observations** that more sophisticated FSI (and possibly binding energy treatments) are needed. Notably, NOvA’s near detector has a hard time catching very low-\$T\_p\$ protons due to detector thresholds, so it relies on simulations tuned by T2K/MINERvA for FSI systematics. MicroBooNE’s data will serve as a valuable input to tune those FSI models for argon – an important step for future liquid argon experiments.

## Resonance and Pion Production Channels (CC)

**CC π<sup>0</sup> Production:** MicroBooNE performed the **first-ever measurement of CC neutral pion production on argon**. In a 2019 letter, they reported the flux-averaged cross section for **ν<sub>μ</sub> + Ar → μ<sup>−</sup> + π<sup>0</sup> + X** (with any number of additional nucleons). This channel proceeds primarily via the Δ(1232) resonance (or higher resonances) excitation and decay (RES interactions), and is a background in ν<sub>e</sub> appearance searches due to π<sup>0</sup> → γγ. MicroBooNE’s analysis required identifying at least one photon shower along with the muon, using LArTPC EM shower reconstruction. They measured a **flux-integrated CC1π<sup>0</sup> cross section** of order 10<sup>−38</sup> cm², and also provided differential distributions (the 2024 follow-up full PRD reports π<sup>0</sup> momentum/angle differentials). **Uncertainties** were relatively large (\~30% total) due to the difficulty of EM shower reco and cosmic backgrounds, but manageable.

**Comparison to GENIE:** Within uncertainties, **MicroBooNE’s CC π<sup>0</sup> results are consistent with GENIE and other model predictions**, with a hint of a lower cross section on Ar than naive scaling from lighter targets. Specifically, when comparing argon data to historical measurements on deuterium and carbon, MicroBooNE observed a **slight deficit (\~1σ low)** relative to GENIE’s prediction. GENIE (with Rein-Sehgal or Berger-Sehgal resonance model) had predicted the argon cross section by extrapolating from lighter nuclei, including an assumed 24–30% non-resonant background component. The data showed that **ANL (D<sub>2</sub>) and MiniBooNE (CH<sub>2</sub>) results were well described by GENIE, while Argon’s measured cross section came out \~10–15% lower** than GENIE’s central value. This small shortfall was also reflected in a comparison to NuWro: MicroBooNE’s σ(Ar) agreed with NuWro’s prediction, whereas MiniBooNE’s σ(C) sits \~20% higher than NuWro expected. In other words, *the models’ nuclear scaling assumptions hold within uncertainties.* The collaboration concludes that the differences are not statistically significant and that **“the GENIE and NuWro generators, tuned to lighter nuclei, describe this process well on argon”**. There is consistency across deuterium, carbon, and argon measurements at the \~1σ level, indicating no dramatic nuclear-dependent modification in resonant pion production. This was an important validation: it suggests that **resonance neutrino production scales to argon without requiring new nuclear effects beyond those already in GENIE (like FSI for pions)**. MicroBooNE did observe that GENIE’s predictions with and without FSI bracketted the data, underscoring the role of final-state pion reinteractions (absorption can lower the observed π<sup>0</sup> count). The best-fit scenario was slightly below the “no FSI” curve, consistent with some pion absorption in Ar.

**Other CC Pion Channels:** While CC π<sup>0</sup> was explicitly measured, MicroBooNE’s data also cover CC π<sup>±</sup> channels implicitly via its inclusive and “with pions” samples. A dedicated measurement of **CC1π<sup>+</sup> on Ar** has not been published as of 2025 for muon neutrinos, but the **proton-tagged vs no-proton analysis** effectively separates CC resonant events (which usually have a proton) from coherent π (which yields no proton). No large anomaly was reported there – suggesting GENIE’s resonant pion rate (Δ production normalization) is reasonable for argon. MicroBooNE did, however, extend pion production studies to **electron neutrinos:** In 2025 the collaboration announced the **first ν<sub>e</sub> and \$\barν\_e\$ CC single charged pion cross sections on argon**. This measurement, using the BNB’s intrinsic ν<sub>e} and some NuMI beam ν<sub>e}, showed that models tuned to ν<sub>μ</sub> data also describe ν<sub>e</sub> interactions well on argon. No significant difference beyond expected radiative corrections was observed between electron and muon neutrino pion production – an important lepton-universality check for GENIE.

**Comparison to Other Experiments:** MicroBooNE’s pion results are **broadly in line with MiniBooNE (CH) and ANL/BNL deuterium data**, which have long anchored GENIE’s resonance models. MiniBooNE measured CC1π<sup>+</sup> and CC1π<sup>0</sup> cross sections at E<sub>ν</sub>\~0.8 GeV (Phys. Rev. D 83 (2011) 052007), and GENIE’s default (Rein-Sehgal) was tuned to those. MicroBooNE’s finding of a slightly lower π<sup>0</sup> cross section on Ar might hint at increased pion absorption or nuclear shadowing in argon, but within errors it aligns with the **trend that heavier nuclei have equal or slightly lower per-nucleon pion production cross sections**. **T2K** (peak E<sub>ν</sub>\~0.6 GeV) has measured CC1π<sup>+/-</sup> on carbon; they found that NEUT needed a \~20% reduction in resonant cross section (and enhanced pion FSI) to match data. That is consistent with MicroBooNE’s \~1σ low observation – not a large discrepancy, but suggestive that original Rein-Sehgal might overshoot slightly. In both cases, after tuning (NEUT for T2K, or GENIE’s uncertainties for MicroBooNE) the data are well described. **MINERvA** (with higher-energy beams) measured CC resonance production on CH and observed significant FSI effects (many pions get absorbed or charge-exchanged). MicroBooNE’s argon data similarly require accounting for pion FSI – which GENIE does via its hA intranuclear cascade. The agreement MicroBooNE sees implies GENIE’s FSI model (which was informed by \$\pi\$-Ar hadron data) is performing adequately in a LAr detector environment. No direct results from NOvA on CC pions exist, but their simulations (using GENIE) have been validated against MINERvA and now indirectly by MicroBooNE, so no glaring tension is expected. Overall, **MicroBooNE’s CC pion measurements support the existing resonance model (Δ-production) and FSI treatments for argon**, with perhaps minor normalization tweaks (a few tens of percent) that are within the GENIE model uncertainties.

## Neutral-Current π<sup>0</sup> Production (ν–Ar NC1π<sup>0</sup>)

Understanding neutral-current (NC) π<sup>0</sup> production is crucial since NC π<sup>0</sup>s are a major background in ν<sub>e</sub> appearance searches (photons mimicking electrons). MicroBooNE has performed the first NC π<sup>0</sup> cross-section measurements on argon. In 2023, it published differential and total cross sections for **NC 1π<sup>0</sup> production**: ν + Ar → ν + π<sup>0</sup> + X (no muon). Events with one neutral pion and any number of nucleons were selected, and separate results for **NC1π<sup>0> with 0 protons vs ≥1 proton** in the final state were also reported. The analysis had significant systematic uncertainties (\~30–40%) due to photon energy scale, cosmic backgrounds, and flux, but still yielded the first quantitative comparison of NC π<sup>0</sup> data to models on argon.

**Results vs GENIE:** MicroBooNE’s NC π<sup>0</sup> data show **reasonable overall agreement with GENIE predictions**, with some interesting deviations in subchannels. In both the inclusive NC π<sup>0</sup> and the proton-tagged exclusive modes, **MicroBooNE observed a slight deficit of events compared to the GENIE-based simulation**. Specifically, **data yields were lower than the GENIE central values**, hinting that GENIE might overestimate the NC π<sup>0</sup> cross section on Ar or mis-model certain components. This deficit was more pronounced in the **NC π<sup>0</sup> + 1p** channel, i.e. events where a pion is produced alongside a visible proton. One possible interpretation is that GENIE’s modeling of resonant π<sup>0</sup> production (which often yields a proton from the Δ decay) overshoots on argon, or that the FSI (pion absorption) is slightly underestimated, leading to fewer π<sup>0</sup> in reality. Conversely, the **NC π<sup>0</sup> + 0p** channel (which can include coherent π<sup>0</sup> production off the whole nucleus, leaving it intact) might be under-predicted by GENIE. MicroBooNE notes that GENIE’s default **coherent NC π<sup>0</sup> cross section on Ar is set lower** than what one would expect from scaling the MiniBooNE (CH<sub>2</sub>) result. MiniBooNE found a significant NC coherent π<sup>0</sup> component on CH; extrapolating to Ar (with A=40) suggests GENIE may *underestimate* coherent π<sup>0</sup> on argon. Thus, if the data have more coherent π<sup>0</sup>s than GENIE thinks, those would mostly appear in the 0p category (no recoil nucleon), potentially explaining part of the discrepancy. Indeed, MicroBooNE hints that a **simultaneous adjustment of non-coherent (resonant) and coherent contributions in GENIE could resolve the differences**. They performed fits allowing the NC resonant axial mass and coherent normalization to vary: while the default GENIE prediction is within uncertainties of the data (p-value \~0.2, so acceptable), a slightly modified model with an enhanced coherent fraction and altered momentum distribution was preferred at \~1.4σ significance. In summary, **GENIE’s NC π<sup>0</sup> model largely agrees with MicroBooNE data (within error bars), but the data hint at systematic differences**: possibly fewer resonant π<sup>0</sup> events with recoil protons and more events consistent with coherent production than GENIE anticipated.

**Uncertainties and Model Tuning:** The NC π<sup>0</sup> measurement uncertainties are sizable, so MicroBooNE did not claim any dramatic discrepancy. The data are consistent with GENIE’s prediction at the 90% confidence level. However, this measurement provides a **valuable validation point for GENIE’s NC sector**. GENIE uses the Rein-Sehgal model for NC Δ production (same vector form factors as CC, axial mass usually 1.0 GeV) and a relatively empirical coherent π model tuned to low-energy data. MicroBooNE’s results will help tune the NC axial mass (M<sub>A</sub><sup>NC</sup>) if needed, and possibly the fraction of interactions going to coherent vs resonant channels on argon. Notably, **no existing data on argon NC π<sup>0</sup> existed before** – generators relied on models scaled from lighter nuclei. MicroBooNE indicates those scaling assumptions are **not wildly wrong (no factor-of-two disagreements)**, but could be adjusted by on the order of 10–20%. They also demonstrated using the NC π<sup>0</sup> data to *constrain* backgrounds: for example, treating GENIE’s overall NC π<sup>0</sup> normalization as a free parameter, the best-fit to MicroBooNE data was somewhat lower than 1 (GENIE likely a bit high) but within error. This kind of *in situ* constraint will be crucial for DUNE, and MicroBooNE has paved the way to incorporate such argon-specific NC tunes.

**Comparison to Other Experiments:** **MiniBooNE** is the most direct comparison – it measured NC π<sup>0</sup> on CH<sub>2</sub> at the same energy. Qualitatively, MicroBooNE’s argon cross section (per nucleon) is **consistent with MiniBooNE’s within uncertainties when accounting for nuclear size**. MiniBooNE saw σ(NC1π<sup>0</sup> on CH) ≈ \$4.3\times10^{-40}\$ cm²/nucleon (in their energy range). Argon being heavier could have a higher coherent contribution, but also more absorption. MicroBooNE’s deficit in the 1p channel (mostly resonant) vs GENIE aligns with MiniBooNE’s observation that some resonant events were being misidentified – MiniBooNE’s data similarly led to tweaks in GENIE’s NC axial mass (MiniBooNE favored M<sub>A</sub>≈1.23 GeV for NC Δ, a bit higher than CC). MicroBooNE’s mild hint of more coherent π<sup>0</sup> is intriguing: MiniBooNE measured coherent π<sup>0</sup> on CH and provided a normalization for GENIE (which GENIE extrapolated to Ar by an \$A^{2/3}\$ rule). If MicroBooNE is seeing that GENIE under-forecasted coherent on Ar, it suggests that simple \$A\$-scaling might undercount coherent scattering on a heavy nucleus. No other experiment has measured NC π<sup>0</sup> on Ar or even on heavy targets (T2K did not have π<sup>0</sup>-sensitive detectors, MINERvA focused on CC). So MicroBooNE’s result stands as **the reference for argon**. The overall takeaway is that **there are no glaring conflicts**: MicroBooNE’s NC π<sup>0</sup> cross section is of similar magnitude to MiniBooNE’s scaled up to Ar, and any differences (like the distribution of protons) are within the realm of model adjustments. This provides confidence that NC π<sup>0</sup> background estimates for argon detectors (like DUNE) based on GENIE can be trusted at least at the \~20% level, and can be further improved by tuning GENIE with MicroBooNE’s data.

## Other Exclusive Channels and GENIE Model Updates

Beyond the main QE, RES, and NC channels, MicroBooNE has measured **rare processes** on argon for the first time, providing important checks on GENIE’s more peripheral models:

* **Charged-Current Kaon Production:** In 2025 MicroBooNE reported the first observation of **ν<sub>μ</sub>-induced CC K<sup>+</sup> production on argon**. This channel, \$\nu\_μ + \text{Ar} \to μ^- + K^+ + X\$, is highly suppressed at E<sub>ν</sub>\~0.8 GeV (threshold ≈0.9 GeV). MicroBooNE identified a handful of events with a stopping K<sup>+> (using its Bragg peak signature) and measured a flux-averaged cross section. The result was σ(ν<sub>μ</sub>CCK<sup>+</sup>) = **\$(7.93 \pm 3.27\_{\rm stat} \pm 2.92\_{\rm syst}) \times 10^{-42}\$ cm²/nucleon**. This is in line with GENIE’s prediction: GENIE v3 estimated \~8.4×10<sup>−42</sup> (v2 gave 8.7×10<sup>−42</sup>), well within the large uncertainty. Other generators (NEUT, NuWro) predicted slightly higher values (9.7–10.9×10<sup>−42</sup>), but again within error bars. Thus, **MicroBooNE’s data did not reveal any correction needed for CC strangeness production** – GENIE’s model (which relies on associated production through resonances like \$p(\nu\_\mu,\mu^- K^+) \Lambda\$) seems adequate. The measurement was statistics-limited (total \~55% uncertainty), but it demonstrates LArTPC capability and provides a baseline for future high-stat samples in DUNE’s near detector. Notably, MicroBooNE had to handle **K<sup>+</sup> final-state interactions** (secondary interactions in argon). They implemented a \$\pm40%\$ uncertainty on K<sup>+</sup>-Ar cross sections (as MINERvA did) to cover GEANT4’s imperfect modeling. This dominated some systematics but did not prevent a cross-section extraction. The result **supports GENIE’s handling of strangeness production and K<sup>+</sup> reinteractions**.

* **η Meson Production:** MicroBooNE also made the **first measurement of CC **η** production** on argon (via resonances like N(1535) → N+η). In 2024, a **signal of 16 η→2γ events** was extracted, yielding a cross section of order 10<sup>−42</sup> cm². Within large uncertainties, **no significant deviation from GENIE** was found – GENIE’s prediction (which is largely extrapolated from proton targets) agreed with the observed rate. This channel is very rare at BNB energies, so the result mainly serves as a proof-of-concept and a constraint on exotic modes.

* **Rare Strange Topologies:** In 2023, MicroBooNE observed the first **quasi-elastic Λ baryon production** in \$\barν\_μ\$ interactions on argon. The reaction \$\barν\_μ + p \to μ^+ + Λ^0\$ (with a spectator K<sup>0</sup>) was identified by the distinctive Λ→pπ<sup>−</sup> decay. Only a handful of events were seen; the cross section is tiny. Still, it validated GENIE’s (and alternate generators’) treatment of Cabibbo-suppressed channels. No obvious anomaly was reported – again, consistency with expectations.

Collectively, these **“other channels”** have not yet required any retuning of GENIE; rather, they bolster confidence that GENIE’s simulation of rare processes (kaon production, associated strangeness, etc.) is in the right range for argon. As statistics accumulate in future LAr experiments, these data will become valuable for refining cross-section submodels (e.g. form factors for N→N+K, or coherent η production, etc.). For now, the agreement is generally within 1σ given large experimental errors, so GENIE’s default remains unchallenged in these modes.

### GENIE Model Refinements Driven by MicroBooNE

MicroBooNE’s extensive cross-section program has directly fed back into GENIE development and tuning:

* **New “MicroBooNE Tune” (GENIE v3.0.6 G18\_10a\_02\_11a):** To better model CC0π (QE-like) interactions on argon, MicroBooNE developed a custom GENIE v3 tune. This tune is *“theory-driven”* – it introduced four fit parameters not well constrained before (the CCQE axial mass M<sub>A</sub>, the 2p2h normalization and shape parameters, and the RPA correlation strength). Instead of fitting MicroBooNE’s own data (to avoid bias in oscillation analyses), they fit to **external T2K ν<sub>μ</sub> CC0π data** in a similar energy range. This independent dataset provided a solid anchor, and the resulting tuned parameters (e.g. a slightly higher axial mass and adjusted 2p2h scale) yield a model that **better matches both T2K and MicroBooNE** cross sections. The default GENIE v3 had already adopted Valencia QE/2p2h models; the tune primarily refined their uncertainties. It found that GENIE v3’s initial settings under-predicted the absolute CC0π rate on carbon and argon (consistent with the “low \$Q^2\$ deficit” mentioned earlier). The MicroBooNE tune raises the 0π cross section and assigns well-motivated uncertainties to cover differences between models. **MicroBooNE has adopted this tune as the baseline for all its analyses since 2021**. Comparisons show the tune significantly improves agreement with MiniBooNE, T2K, and MicroBooNE data in the CCQE channel. Notably, the tune was done **independently of MicroBooNE’s own data** (no MicroBooNE points were used in the fit), but after tuning, they checked it **against MicroBooNE measurements (“MicroBooNE Tune” vs data)** and found much improved consistency, validating the approach. This tune has been documented in Phys. Rev. D 105, 072001 (2022) and is being used by other LArTPC experiments and the GENIE collaboration as a starting model for low-energy argon interactions.

* **FSI and 2p2h Modeling:** While the MicroBooNE tune focused on QE and 2p2h parameters, **MicroBooNE’s data have illuminated FSI shortcomings** that will guide future GENIE updates. The 0p vs 1p study showed that **GENIE’s hA cascade might under-handle nucleon FSI**, particularly for sub-50 MeV protons. GENIE developers, informed by this, are considering incorporating transport-based FSI options (GENIE’s newer “hN” model or data-driven improvements). Additionally, MicroBooNE’s measured distributions of **transverse kinematic imbalance** (Phys. Rev. Lett. 131, 101802 (2023)) provide detailed information on FSI and 2p2h mechanisms – e.g. preferential directions of missing momentum that can distinguish FSI from 2p2h. These measurements are already used to validate GENIE’s semi-classical FSI algorithm. If needed, GENIE can tune the intranuclear interaction probabilities (e.g. pion absorption rates, nucleon interaction lengths) using the argon data.

* **Resonance and NC Adjustments:** MicroBooNE’s pion data, showing a slight deficit, fall within GENIE’s model uncertainty bands. However, should combined data (Ar + CH + D<sub>2</sub>) consistently indicate a normalization offset, GENIE may retune the **RES axial mass (M<sub>A</sub><sup>RES</sup>) or vector form factors**. Currently GENIE uses M<sub>A</sub><sup>RES</sup>=1.12 GeV; MicroBooNE’s data (with T2K’s) might favor a tad lower (\~1.0–1.05) to reduce cross section by \~10%. Similarly for NC π<sup>0</sup>, GENIE could increase the coherent fraction on Ar based on MicroBooNE’s hint. These would be minor (\~1σ) shifts and can be implemented in future GENIE tunes (e.g. GENIE v3.2+).

In summary, **MicroBooNE’s cross-section program has significantly advanced our understanding of neutrino-argon interactions**. It confirmed many aspects of the GENIE model (with modern nuclear physics) on a heavy target – CCQE strength with RPA/2p2h, resonant pion rates, etc. – and it identified areas for improvement like nucleon FSI and perhaps coherent pion production. Comparisons with **MINERvA, T2K, NOvA and others show a generally consistent picture**: when each experiment uses a GENIE tuned to the latest global data (now including MicroBooNE’s), the predictions are largely in accord with observations across different targets and energies. There remain some **tensions in details** (e.g. exactly how many 0p events, or the precise low-\$Q^2\$ shape), but these are at the level that model tuning and uncertainties can accommodate. The data from MicroBooNE have already prompted tuning (the MicroBooNE tune) and will feed into the next GENIE global fit. Finally, MicroBooNE’s work is **highly complementary** to that of MINERvA, T2K, and NOvA: where MINERvA provided high-energy baseline and T2K provided similar-energy light-target data, MicroBooNE filled in the gap of a *low-energy heavy-target* dataset. Together, these experiments’ results give a cohesive story and significantly improved the neutrino interaction models that will be used by the upcoming DUNE and SBN oscillation searches.

| **CC Inclusive (ν<sub>μ</sub>Ar)**      | First double-differential σ on Ar; energy-dependent σ(E) measured. Total σ consistent with expectation (∼10<sup>−38</sup> cm²). Uncertainties \~15%. Shape: suppressed at low p<sub>μ</sub>, enhanced at high angle.                                                                                                                          | GENIE v2 (no RPA) **over-predicted** low-\$Q^2\$ cross section; strongly disfavored by data. GENIE v3 (with RPA+MEC) gives much better agreement (χ² reduced by >50%). MicroBooNE-tuned GENIE further improves σ(E) agreement.                                                                                                                                                                                                           | T2K (C/O, 0.6 GeV) also required RPA & 2p2h in models – now included in NEUT/GENIE. MINERvA (CH, 3 GeV) saw low-recoil excess resolved by 2p2h inclusion, similar to MicroBooNE. NOvA (CH, 2 GeV) uses GENIE tuned with these effects; no major disagreements with MicroBooNE after tuning.                                                                                                                                                          |
| **CCQE-Like (1μ1p, 0π)**                | Flux-avg. σ(1μ1p) measured; multi-differential cross sections show overall agreement with GENIE within \~20%. Notable **deficit at low momentum transfer** (forward μ angles) – data exceed GENIE at very low Q². CC 2p final state observed at expected rate (large stat. uncertainty).                                                      | GENIE v3 (Valencia QE+MEC, RPA) **matches overall normalization and most shape**. Only low-\$Q^2\$ region shows discrepancy – GENIE may over-suppress cross section there. GENIE v2 without these nuclear effects gave poor fit (χ²/ndf > 2). MicroBooNE’s tune adjusted M<sub>A</sub>, RPA, 2p2h to better fit QE data.                                                                                                                 | T2K (C) QE data similarly needed a higher M<sub>A</sub> and 2p2h component; their tuned NEUT model is consistent with MicroBooNE’s tune. MINERvA (CH) QE found GENIE v2 lacking strength at high recoil – adding MEC fixed it, in line with MicroBooNE’s findings. NOvA relies on GENIE models validated by T2K/MINERvA; MicroBooNE’s argon QE data extends validation to A=40 with no new physics required.                                         |
| **Hadronic Final State (0p vs 1p)**     | First split of CC cross sections by proton count. **Data show more 0p (no-proton) events** than GENIE/NEUT predict. Only GiBUU’s FSI model reproduces the sharp 0p peak. Implies strong FSI causing invisible protons. Uncert. \~20–30%.                                                                                                      | GENIE (hA2018 cascade) **under-predicts 0p cross section** (i.e. missing strength at \$T\_p<35\$ MeV). NEUT similarly low in 0p due to its nucleon FSI cutoff. Both GENIE/NEUT do well on inclusive (0p+1p) but fail when split. Suggests FSI model in GENIE needs more nucleon re-scattering/absorption.                                                                                                                                | No direct 0p measurements on C/H<sub>2</sub>, but MINERvA saw hints of excess low-\$p\$ protons (or neutrons) not captured by GENIE FSI. T2K’s carbon data and GiBUU studies also indicate standard cascades may be too optimistic about proton escape. MicroBooNE’s result is complementary, pushing GENIE to adopt more realistic FSI for heavy Ar – important for DUNE ND.                                                                        |
| **CC Resonant Pion (Δ→Nπ)**             | **CC1π<sup>0</sup> on Ar** measured (2019): σ slightly (\~10%) below GENIE prediction but within 1σ. Differential spectra (2024) show consistency with GENIE+FSI shape. No dramatic nuclear effect observed. Uncert. \~30%.                                                                                                                   | GENIE’s resonant model (Rein-Sehgal/Berger-Sehgal) **describes Ar data well**, with only a slight normalization overshoot (data deficit \~1σ). GENIE predicted Ar vs C scaling within uncertainties – MicroBooNE confirms validity. Pion FSI in GENIE (hA model) seems adequate (argon data between GENIE’s “no FSI” and “with FSI” curves).                                                                                             | MiniBooNE (CH<sub>2</sub>) and ANL (D<sub>2</sub>) data were well described by GENIE – MicroBooNE adds that argon follows suit. T2K (C) found a slight over-prediction of CC1π<sup>+<sup> by models, consistent with MicroBooNE’s \~10% low trend; T2K tuned down resonance norm \~20%. MINERvA (CH, higher E) saw significant FSI (absorption) – MicroBooNE’s agreement suggests GENIE’s handling of FSI from π on Ar is reasonable at \~1 GeV.     |
| **NC Single π<sup>0</sup>**             | **NC 1π<sup>0</sup>** inclusive and split (0p/1p) measured on Ar. Total σ roughly as expected, \~1σ below GENIE central value. **Data deficit in π<sup>0</sup>+p channel** (resonant) and possibly higher fraction of π<sup>0</sup> with no recoil (coherent). Large errors (\~30–40%).                                                       | GENIE **slightly over-predicts NC π<sup>0</sup> yield** on Ar (χ² indicates better fit with a small normalization drop). Default GENIE coherent π^0 on Ar is low; MicroBooNE hints it might be underestimated. A mild increase in coherent and decrease in resonant π^0 production would improve agreement (preferred at 1.4σ). Overall, GENIE’s prediction lies within data uncertainties – no major revision needed, just fine tuning. | MiniBooNE (CH) provided GENIE’s baseline for NC π^0. MicroBooNE’s results on Ar are **consistent** with a scaled MiniBooNE, confirming no huge nuclear effect. MiniBooNE saw a substantial coherent component; MicroBooNE suggests Ar’s coherent is relatively stronger than GENIE assumed, aligning with coherent π^0 cross-section’s ∼A<sup>2/3</sup> growth. No other experiments have NC π^0 on Ar – MicroBooNE’s data will tune GENIE for DUNE. |
| **Rare Channels (K<sup>+</sup>, η, Λ)** | **CC K<sup>+</sup> production:** first measurement on Ar, σ ≈ \$8×10^{-42}\$ cm² with 55% unc. **Consistent with GENIE** (predictions 8–10×10<sup>−42</sup>). <br> **CC η:** first observation on Ar, very low yield; consistent with GENIE within large errors. <br> **\$\barν\_μ\$-Λ (strange QE):** observed at expected rate, no anomaly. | GENIE v3’s cross-section models for associated strangeness and rare mesons appear **accurate** for argon. The data all fall within GENIE’s uncertainty bands. No tuning done yet (statistical precision limited), but results **validate GENIE’s baseline** for these channels.                                                                                                                                                          | MINERvA (CH) measured ν-induced K<sup>+</sup> at higher E and found GENIE agreeable; MicroBooNE extends validation to threshold region on Ar. T2K/NOvA haven’t seen these channels (low rates). MicroBooNE provides unique input – though no discrepancies to exploit, it gives confidence for future high-stat samples (e.g. Hyper-K, DUNE ND) to refine these processes.                                                                           |
