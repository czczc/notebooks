## Part I: Basic Theory and Formalism

### Day 1: Weak Interaction Formalism and Cross-Section Basics

* **Topics:** Neutrino weak interactions (CC and NC); electroweak Lagrangian and Feynman diagrams for \$\nu\$ scattering; cross-section definitions and units; two-body scattering kinematics; neutrino-lepton vs neutrino-nucleon scattering.
* **Learning Objectives:**

  * Review the structure of the charged-current (CC) and neutral-current (NC) weak interactions in the Standard Model.
  * Derive the basic form of a differential cross section from a given matrix element (simple 2-body case).
  * Understand key kinematic variables (four-momentum transfer \$q^2\$, invariant mass \$W\$, inelasticity \$y\$) and how they describe neutrino interactions.
* **Lecture Content:** The session begins with the simplest case of neutrino-electron scattering to establish formalism and notation. We then introduce neutrino-nucleon scattering: a muon neutrino \$\nu\_\mu\$ can scatter off a proton or neutron via \$W^\pm\$ exchange (CC) or off a nucleon via \$Z^0\$ (NC). The V–A structure of the weak current is reviewed, including how left-handed neutrinos couple to \$W\$ and \$Z\$ bosons. We derive the general formula for a two-body scattering cross section from first principles (phase space, matrix element) and discuss how form factors enter the hadronic current. Key distinctions between neutrino and anti-neutrino cross sections are noted (e.g. \$\sigma\_{\bar\nu}\$ is roughly half of \$\sigma\_{\nu}\$ in many regimes). Throughout, we emphasize that while writing the electroweak Lagrangian seems to give a “complete” description, in practice *many additional effects complicate predictions* – including uncertain initial nuclear states, important nuclear corrections, and final-state interactions. This motivates the need for nuclear modeling in subsequent lectures.
* **Recommended Reading:**

  * Formaggio & Zeller, *Rev. Mod. Phys.* **84**, 1307 (2012) – **Section II** introduces neutrino cross-section formalism across energy regimes.
  * G. P. Zeller, *Particle Data Group Review (2020)*, “Neutrino Cross Section Measurements” – **Sec. 51.1** (intro & Fig. 51.1) for an overview of \$\nu\$–nucleon cross sections vs. energy.
  * (Optional) B. Pontecorvo, *Phys. Rev.* **72**, 246 (1947) – historical perspective on weak interactions (for context, not required).
* **Homework (Optional):** Using the tree-level \$W\$-exchange diagram, derive the differential cross section \$d\sigma/dQ^2\$ for inverse muon decay (the process \$\nu\_\mu + e^- \to \mu^- + \nu\_e\$). Assume \$m\_e \approx 0\$ and compare with the result for \$\nu\_\mu\$–nucleon scattering (neglecting nuclear effects). This will reinforce handling of Lorentz invariants and matrix elements.

### Day 2: Quasi-Elastic Scattering on Nucleons and Nuclei

* **Topics:** Charged-current quasi-elastic (CCQE) scattering off free nucleons (e.g. \$\nu\_\mu n \to \mu^- p\$); nucleon form factors (vector and axial); impulse approximation and basic nuclear models (Fermi gas); extension of QE to nuclear targets (carbon, argon) and nuclear effects (Fermi motion, Pauli blocking, nucleon correlations).
* **Learning Objectives:**

  * Master the formalism for CCQE neutrino-nucleon scattering (Llewellyn Smith model), including the role of form factors (e.g. \$F\_V\$, \$F\_A\$) in the weak hadronic current.
  * Understand how nuclear targets modify QE interactions: initial state nucleon momentum distributions, binding energy, and the distinction between QE on hydrogen (free proton) vs. on complex nuclei.
  * Learn why modern experiments often report “CC0\$\pi\$” (zero-pion) or QE-like cross sections, and how final-state interactions (FSI) blur the line between true QE and other processes.
* **Lecture Content:** We begin by reviewing CCQE scattering on a free nucleon. The classic form of the differential cross section (after C.H. Llewellyn Smith) is presented, showing dependence on the axial-vector form factor \$F\_A(Q^2)\$ and vector form factors \$F\_{1,2}(Q^2)\$. Vector form factors are taken from electron-scattering data via the Conserved Vector Current (CVC) hypothesis, while \$F\_A\$ is typically assumed to have a dipole form \$F\_A(Q^2) = g\_A/(1+Q^2/M\_A^2)^2\$ with \$g\_A \approx 1.267\$ and axial mass \$M\_A \sim 1.0\$ GeV. We discuss how uncertainties in \$M\_A\$ affect predicted cross sections. The lecture then shifts to neutrino scattering on nuclei: in light targets like hydrogen/deuterium (as in early bubble chambers), a QE interaction cleanly yields a lepton and one nucleon. In heavier targets (C, O, Ar), the same initial interaction is modified by Fermi motion (nucleons have initial momentum), Pauli blocking (the outgoing nucleon might occupy an already-filled state), and nuclear binding energy. As a result, a nominal “QE” interaction inside a nucleus may eject additional nucleons or leave the nucleus in an excited state. We introduce the Relativistic Fermi Gas (RFG) model as a starting point for nuclear modeling, and note its limitations: e.g. data from modern experiments showed that a simple Fermi gas with \$M\_A=1.0\$ GeV underestimates some QE cross sections, requiring an effective \$M\_A \approx 1.2\$ GeV to fit observations. This discrepancy hinted at **nucleon-nucleon correlations** and multi-nucleon processes (“\$2p2h\$” interactions), which we briefly introduce. We also highlight how experiments define **CC0π** (zero-pion final state) to identify QE-like events in nuclei – since FSI can cause a true QE to produce extra nucleons, or a resonance event to produce no pion (if the pion is absorbed). This session sets the stage for exploring resonance and multi-nucleon contributions next.
* **Recommended Reading:**

  * J. Nieves *et al.*, *Phys. Rev. C* **83**, 045501 (2011) – a detailed nuclear model for QE scattering (for those interested in the microscopic nuclear physics).
  * Particle Data Group (2020) – **Sec. 51.2 Quasi-elastic scattering**, for a concise summary of QE interactions and modern measurements.
  * (Optional) C.H. Llewellyn Smith, *Phys. Rept.* **3**, 261 (1972) – original derivation of neutrino-nucleon QE cross sections.
* **Homework (Optional):** Using a Fermi gas model, estimate the fraction of QE neutrino interactions on \${}^{40}\$Ar that result in exactly one proton in the final state (hint: consider nucleon Fermi momentum and the likelihood of nucleon-nucleon correlations). Alternatively, students can be given a simplified model to compute the QE cross section on carbon vs. on free nucleons and discuss the differences.

### Day 3: Resonance Production and Pion Channels

* **Topics:** Neutrino-induced resonance excitation (especially \$\Delta(1232)\$) and subsequent pion production; Rein-Sehgal model for single-pion production; transition region between QE and DIS (often called “Resonance” or RES region); coherent pion production (neutrino scatters off entire nucleus producing a pion without breaking the nucleus).
* **Learning Objectives:**

  * Understand the mechanism of neutrino *resonance production*: a neutrino excites a nucleon to a baryon resonance (e.g. \$\Delta^{++}\$ or \$N^\*\$), which then decays (typically producing one or more pions).
  * Learn the main theoretical models for calculating resonance cross sections (Rein-Sehgal model) and what approximations they involve (e.g. summing Breit-Wigner resonances).
  * Appreciate nuclear medium effects on pion production: pion re-scattering or absorption in the nucleus, and the phenomenon of coherent pion production.
* **Lecture Content:** This session focuses on the intermediate energy regime (\~1–3 GeV) where *resonant inelastic* processes dominate alongside QE. We start with the example of \$\nu\_\mu p \to \mu^- p \pi^+\$ via the \$\Delta^{++}\$ resonance (and analogous channels on neutrons producing \$\Delta^+\$). The dynamics of resonance excitation are introduced: the \$W\$ boson can couple to an \$N\to N^\*\$ transition. We discuss the Rein-Sehgal model (a widely used approach) which treats pion production by summing contributions of multiple baryon resonances (like \$\Delta(1232), N(1520)\$, etc.). The cross section for each resonance is computed and weighted by the resonance’s decay branching ratio into the channel of interest. We note that *generator implementations vary*: e.g., how many resonances are included, whether interference between resonances is accounted coherently or not, and what axial-vector form factors are assumed. The lecture then examines how resonance production appears in nuclei: the \$\Delta\$ created inside a nucleus can produce a pion that might be absorbed or undergo charge exchange before exiting. Such **final-state interactions (FSI)** mean the observed final state (e.g. one muon + one proton + no pion) could come from a true QE or a resonant event with a pion absorbed. We also introduce **coherent pion production**: a special case where a neutrino scatters off the entire nucleus (via coherent neutral current or CC interaction), leaving the nucleus intact and producing a single pion. Coherent pions typically concentrate at small angles and low \$Q^2\$. We highlight that coherent CC\$\pi^+\$ production has a considerably smaller cross section (a few percent of total at 1 GeV) and was confirmed by experiments (e.g. MINERvA and T2K). If time permits, we connect to current theory efforts – e.g. updated single-pion models that better incorporate electroproduction data – showing that theory is evolving to address discrepancies between Rein-Sehgal and data.
* **Recommended Reading:**

  * E.A. Paschos & J.-Y. Yu, *Phys. Rev. D* **65**, 033002 (2002) – discussion of coherent pion production and conditions for coherence.
  * Particle Data Group (2020) – see **“Neutrino Cross Section Measurements” Sec. 51.3 Pion Production**, for a summary of experimental status of resonant and coherent pion channels (including Table 51.4 of measurements).
  * (Optional) D. Rein and L.M. Sehgal, *Annals of Phys.* **133**, 79 (1981) – original paper formulating the neutrino resonance (single-pion) model used in many generators.
* **Suggested Problem:** *“Resonance vs QE Discrimination.”* Students are given a scenario: a muon neutrino interaction in a mineral oil (CH$\_2\$) detector yields a muon, a proton, and no pion. They must discuss how one would determine if this event was QE or a \$\Delta\$ resonance with an absorbed pion. What observables (e.g. kinematics of the proton vs muon) could help discriminate? This thought exercise solidifies understanding of how different processes can mimic each other in a detector due to FSI.

### Day 4: Deep Inelastic Scattering (DIS) and High-Energy Regime

* **Topics:** Neutrino scattering at high energies (≥ a few GeV) off quark constituents in nucleons; parton distribution functions (PDFs) and structure functions \$F\_2\$, \$F\_3\$; transition from resonances to DIS (shallow inelastic region); nuclear effects in DIS (shadowing, EMC effect).
* **Learning Objectives:**

  * Explain how neutrinos probe the quark structure of nucleons at high energies via deep inelastic scattering (DIS), producing multiple-hadron final states.
  * Understand the use of structure functions \$F\_2(x,Q^2)\$ and \$F\_3(x,Q^2)\$ in the neutrino cross-section formula, and the difference between neutrino and charged-lepton DIS structure functions (e.g. presence of parity-violating \$F\_3\$ term in \$\nu\$ scattering).
  * Be aware of nuclear modifications to DIS: shadowing at low \$x\$, the EMC effect at intermediate \$x\$, and how generators avoid double counting between resonance and DIS regimes.
* **Lecture Content:** We begin by framing DIS as the regime where the *neutrino’s target is a parton (quark)* inside the nucleon. At neutrino energies of several GeV and above, the momentum transfer can be high enough that the neutrino resolves individual quarks. The differential cross section is expressed in terms of structure functions: \$d^2\sigma/dx,dQ^2 \propto \left\[ F\_1(x,Q^2) \pm F\_3(x,Q^2) \right]\$ for \$\nu\$ vs \$\bar\nu\$ (with the \$\pm\$ reflecting the parity-violating term \$F\_3\$). We review how \$F\_2\$ and \$F\_3\$ are related to quark and antiquark momentum distributions in the target. A brief recap of QCD factorization is given: at sufficiently high \$Q^2\$, the cross section factorizes into a hard partonic cross section (calculable in perturbative QCD) and parton distribution functions that are obtained from global fits. Students learn that at \$E\_\nu \sim 5\$–10 GeV, neutrino interactions can produce 2 or more pions (or even hadronic jets) as signatures of DIS. We then examine the *shallow inelastic scattering (SIS)* region – the overlap between resonance and DIS. Generators have to decide how to join models in this region of moderate \$W\$ (\~1.5–2 GeV) to avoid double counting. The concept of a hadronization model is introduced: after the neutrino knocks out quarks, how are the outgoing hadrons (pions, kaons, nucleons, etc.) generated? We note that generators like GENIE often interface with PYTHIA for hadronization above a certain invariant mass. Finally, nuclear effects in DIS are discussed: at small Bjorken-\$x\$, **shadowing** can reduce cross sections on heavy nuclei; at mid-\$x\$, the EMC effect can modify quark distributions; at high \$x\$, Fermi motion can enhance cross sections. These effects mean neutrino DIS cross sections on iron or argon differ slightly from hydrogen. We mention that experiments (like CDHS, CCFR, NuTeV) measured neutrino structure functions, and that such data are input to global PDF fits. By the end of Part I, students see the full landscape of neutrino interactions: QE, resonance, and DIS – each contributing significantly in the few-GeV range.
* **Recommended Reading:**

  * Particle Data Group (2020) – **Sec. 43.1.3 Deep and Shallow Inelastic Scattering** in “Monte Carlo Neutrino Generators” (discusses how generators handle the DIS/SIS region).
  * J.A. Formaggio & G.P. Zeller (2012) – **Section V (Intermediate and High Energy Interactions)** for an accessible overview of neutrino DIS and structure functions.
  * (Optional) U.K. Yang and A. Bodek, *Phys. Rev. Lett.* **82**, 2467 (1999) – on modifications of PDFs (Bodek-Yang model) at low \$Q^2\$ for neutrino DIS.
* **Homework (Optional):** **“Structure Function Exercise.”** Given the parton distribution functions for \$u(x), d(x)\$ in the proton, students are asked to compute the neutrino-proton deep-inelastic cross section at a fixed \$Q^2\$ in two cases: (a) using an isoscalar target (equal number of protons/neutrons), (b) using pure proton target. This will illustrate how \$\nu\$ picks out specific quark flavors (via \$W^+\$ coupling to \$d\$ quarks predominantly) and show the difference between \$\nu\$ and \$\bar\nu\$ cross sections (through the \$F\_3\$ term integration). (The instructor can provide simplified PDFs or a code snippet for this exercise.)

## Part II: Neutrino Interaction Generators

### Day 5: Introduction to Neutrino Event Generators – The Case of GENIE

* **Topics:** Role of event generators in neutrino experiments; overview of GENIE (Generating Events for Neutrino Interaction Experiments) – architecture and design; physics models in GENIE for QE, RES, DIS, etc.; input requirements (flux, geometry) and output (event record); example of using GENIE for a simulation.
* **Learning Objectives:**

  * Grasp *why* Monte Carlo neutrino event generators are essential in analysis of neutrino experiments – converting theoretical cross sections into simulated event samples.
  * Learn the basic structure of GENIE: its modular physics model components for each interaction channel, and how it interfaces with detector simulations.
  * Step through a simple GENIE simulation workflow (e.g. generate events for \$\nu\_\mu\$ on argon at \$E\_\nu=1\$ GeV) to see how cross-section formulas are implemented in practice.
* **Lecture Content:** This session opens Part II by contextualizing generators: modern oscillation and cross-section experiments rely on detailed simulations to design detectors, estimate efficiencies, and compare data to theory. We enumerate the major neutrino MC generators: **GENIE** (widely used in US-led experiments), **NEUT** (used by T2K/Super-K), **NuWro** (a fast academic generator), **GiBUU** (transport-model based), among others. The focus is on GENIE as a case study. We describe GENIE’s goals – a “universal” generator covering broad energies (MeV to TeV) and targets, emphasizing the few-GeV range relevant to long-baseline experiments. The lecture then breaks down GENIE’s components:

  * *Physics Models:* GENIE uses specific models for each process: e.g. for CCQE, a Llewellyn-Smith formalism with a dipole axial form factor (default \$M\_A \approx 0.99\$ GeV); for resonances, the Rein-Sehgal model is default; for DIS, GENIE uses PDFs (GRV98 LO by default in older versions) with modifications at low \$Q^2\$ (Bodek-Yang scaling). We note GENIE’s recent versions allow alternate models (e.g. local Fermi gas or spectral function for nuclear model, tuneable \$M\_A\$).
  * *Intranuclear Cascade (Final-State Interactions):* After the primary interaction, GENIE simulates FSI – how pions and nucleons propagate out of the nucleus, possibly using semi-classical intranuclear cascade models. This affects the observable final state.
  * *Software Architecture:* A brief overview of how GENIE is structured (object-oriented C++): event generation jobs take as input a neutrino flux spectrum, a geometry (e.g. detector material composition), and then loop over neutrinos to generate interactions. We mention GENIE’s concept of “tunes” – sets of model parameter choices fit to external data.
  * *Example:* The instructor might show a short demo (or pseudo-code) for generating 1000 \$\nu\_\mu\$–Ar events in GENIE, and demonstrate how one inspects an event record (to see, for example, a CCQE event with given kinematics).

  We emphasize that event generators implement the physics from Part I, but often in *approximated or empirical ways*. As seen in GENIE, many choices (form factors, resonance amplitudes, hadronization thresholds) are not unique – this introduces the concept of **generator systematics**, which we explore on Day 6. By the end of Day 5, students should be comfortable with what GENIE does internally and ready to learn how it compares to other tools.
* **Recommended Reading:**

  * C. Andreopoulos *et al.* (GENIE Collaboration), *Nucl. Instrum. Meth. A* **614**, 87 (2010) – **GENIE design and physics overview** (sections on each interaction channel, and software framework).
  * Particle Data Group (2020) – **Sec. 43.2 and 43.3** in “Monte Carlo Neutrino Generators” for a succinct summary of how generators handle hadronization and nuclear physics (e.g. intranuclear rescattering).
  * (Optional) GENIE User Manual (available on GENIE website, latest version) – especially the quickstart and physics configuration sections, to see practical usage.
* **In-Class Exercise:** (No graded homework, but an interactive activity) – The instructor provides two GENIE configuration “tunes” for CCQE: one with a global Fermi gas model and \$M\_A=0.99\$ GeV, and another with a local Fermi gas + RPA (nuclear screening) and \$M\_A=1.2\$ GeV. Students predict qualitatively how the muon \$d\sigma/dQ^2\$ distribution will differ between the two tunes for \$\nu\_\mu\$ on carbon at 1 GeV. This exercise connects generator settings to physical effects (RPA suppression at low \$Q^2\$, etc.) and will be discussed in class.

### Day 6: Generator Comparisons, Uncertainties, and Experiment Interface

* **Topics:** Comparison of GENIE with other generators (NEUT, NuWro, GiBUU); how different generators implement physics (e.g. different nuclear models, form factor values); systematic uncertainties from cross-section modeling; tuning generators to data; how generators are used in experimental analyses (event simulation, detector response, and unfolding).
* **Learning Objectives:**

  * Recognize key differences among neutrino event generators: for example, NEUT’s vs GENIE’s default nuclear model (relativistic Fermi gas in GENIE vs spectral function in NEUT), or GiBUU’s transport approach vs GENIE’s factorized approach.
  * Understand how uncertainties in cross-section models are assessed and handled: parameters like \$M\_A\$, or choices like whether to include 2p2h processes, are varied to see their effect on predictions.
  * Learn how generators interface with experiments: in neutrino oscillation analyses (near/far detector simulations) and cross-section measurements (efficiency corrections and comparisons).
* **Lecture Content:** We start by surveying other generators to complement the GENIE-centric view:

  * **NEUT:** used in T2K/Super-K, written in Fortran/C++; we note it has physics tuned to mainly 1 GeV energies and uses e.g. a spectral function model for nuclear binding in recent versions.
  * **NuWro:** a Polish-developed generator aiming to quickly test new models; often the first to implement new theory ideas (e.g. microscopical 2p2h models) but not typically used as the primary simulation of large experiments. We highlight one or two unique features (e.g. different treatment of non-resonant background in pion production).
  * **GiBUU:** a very different approach using transport equations; GiBUU handles FSI by propagating particles in a nuclear potential, which can give a more unified treatment of final-state interactions and hadronic re-scattering.
  * (If applicable, mention others briefly: e.g. **FLUKA**’s neutrino codes, **MARLEY** for low-energy \$\nu\$-Ar, etc., to show completeness.)

  We then discuss *why do generators disagree?* Students see that, for instance, the same QE event might be predicted with different cross section by GENIE vs NuWro if one uses a larger axial mass or includes nucleon-nucleon correlations explicitly. Figure X (conceptual, not shown) could illustrate how GENIE and NEUT predictions for a T2K measurement differed by \~10–20%. This naturally leads to **model uncertainties**: experiments assign systematic uncertainties for these differences. We explain that generator teams provide tools to vary model parameters (“reweighting”) to see effect on observables. For example, one can vary \$M\_A\$ by \$\pm0.1\$ GeV and see a \~10% change in QE cross section. We cite how *“all simulation codes face challenges in describing the full extent of lepton scattering data, and there is tension between incorporating the best nuclear physics and fitting data”*. This underscores that no generator is perfect – each makes compromises, and this is an area of active development.

  Finally, we cover how generators are *integrated into experimental workflows*:

  * In **oscillation experiments** (like DUNE or T2K), a generator simulates interactions in both near and far detectors. By taking the ratio, some uncertainties cancel, but cross-section model differences can still affect extrapolation. Experiments therefore tune the generator to near detector data to reduce mismatches.
  * In **cross-section measurements**, the raw data (observable distributions) must be corrected for detector efficiency and acceptance. Here, generators are used to simulate the detector and to *unfold* the data to true cross sections. The results often depend on the generator model (model-dependent corrections), which is why experiments attempt to provide results in less model-dependent ways (e.g. reporting observable-specific cross sections, like flux-integrated differential cross sections with minimal nuclear model assumptions). We mention recent efforts to make model-independent comparisons, e.g. by publishing covariance matrices so theorists can re-fold their models.

  The lecture ends by reinforcing that an intimate knowledge of generator physics is crucial for modern neutrino experimentalists – it’s the bridge between theoretical models and actual data.
* **Recommended Reading:**

  * Particle Data Group (2020) – **Sec. 43.3 Nuclear Physics in Generators**, which details how different generators address nuclear effects and the known issues (e.g. the need for better models beyond Fermi gas).
  * NuSTEC White Paper (Alvarez-Ruso *et al.*, 2018), *Prog. Part. Nucl. Phys.* **100**, 1 – **Sections 2 & 3**, discussing generator models and their uncertainties.
  * (Optional) T2K Collaboration, *Phys. Rev. D* **93**, 112012 (2016) – example of an oscillation analysis’ treatment of cross-section systematics (details how ND280 data constrain NEUT generator parameters).
* **Homework (Optional):** Students are given some MiniBooNE \$\nu\_\mu\$ CCQE data (double-differential \$\frac{d^2\sigma}{dT\_\mu d\cos\theta\_\mu}\$) and two generator predictions (e.g. one from GENIE, one from NuWro). The task is to quantify which generator fits the data better and to suggest what changes in the physics model might be needed for the worse-fitting generator. This exercise mimics the tuning process: adjusting model parameters to data.

## Part III: Experimental Measurements and Applications

### Day 7: Historical and Modern Neutrino Cross-Section Experiments

* **Topics:** Overview of neutrino cross-section measurements from past to present: early bubble chamber experiments (ANL, BNL, Gargamelle) on hydrogen/deuterium and heavy targets; dedicated cross-section experiments in the 2000s (MiniBooNE, SciBooNE, MINERvA, T2K ND280, MicroBooNE, etc.); inclusive vs exclusive measurements; the role of near detectors in oscillation experiments as cross-section experiments in their own right.
* **Learning Objectives:**

  * Trace the evolution of neutrino cross-section measurements, appreciating how target materials and detector technologies changed over time.
  * Identify key contributions of modern experiments: e.g. MiniBooNE’s finding of higher QE-like cross section that spurred interest in multi-nucleon effects, MINERvA’s extensive target comparisons for nuclear effects, T2K’s precise measurements on carbon and oxygen, MicroBooNE’s argon data.
  * Understand how systematic uncertainties (flux normalization, detector efficiency) impact cross-section measurements and how experiments address them (e.g. hadron production data for flux tuning, external measurements).
* **Lecture Content:** We start in the 1970s: the advent of neutrino beams at CERN and Fermilab led to bubble chamber experiments (like ANL, BNL) that measured CCQE and single-pion production on hydrogen and deuterium. These experiments provided clean data (free of nuclear complications) and established baseline cross sections (e.g. the axial form factor value was extracted as \$M\_A\approx1.03\$ GeV from deuterium QE data). Fast forward, we note a long gap where cross-section measurements were not the main focus (oscillation discoveries took center stage). However, with modern oscillation experiments, a renewed emphasis on interaction measurements emerged (\~2005 onward). We highlight:

  * **MiniBooNE (BNL MicroBooNE’s predecessor at Fermilab):** Operating at \$E\_\nu\sim0.8\$ GeV on CH$\_2\$ oil, it measured CCQE, CC1\$\pi\$, etc. MiniBooNE’s QE-like cross section was higher than expected from historical data, indicating nuclear effects (2p2h). This result sparked significant theory activity.
  * **SciBooNE:** a short-lived follow-up to MiniBooNE with fine-grained tracking, providing additional cross-section data on carbon at similar energies.
  * **MINERvA:** A dedicated cross-section experiment in the NuMI beam at Fermilab covering 1–20 GeV. We note its high precision studies of many channels and, uniquely, its use of multiple nuclear targets (CH, C, Fe, Pb, LHe) to study nuclear dependence of interactions. MINERvA measured ratios of cross sections on different nuclei, providing direct insight into nuclear effects (e.g. comparing carbon vs lead).
  * **T2K Near Detector (ND280):** While primarily for oscillations, ND280 has a robust cross-section program at \$E\_\nu\sim0.6\$ GeV. It has measured differential cross sections on carbon and oxygen (water module) and even cross-section ratios (e.g. \$\sigma\$(H$\_2\$O)/\$\sigma\$(CH)), which help cancel flux uncertainties.
  * **MicroBooNE:** A liquid argon TPC at Fermilab (same beam as MiniBooNE) focusing on argon cross sections at \~\$0.8\$ GeV. We mention that MicroBooNE provided the first detailed cross section measurements on argon in this energy range (e.g. \$\nu\_\mu\$ CC inclusive on Ar, and exclusive channels). It also pioneered new techniques like measuring charged-particle multiplicity in \$\nu\$-Ar interactions.
  * **ArgoNeuT:** A small LAr TPC that took data in the NuMI beam (\~3 GeV average), produced one of the first CCQE and CC\$\pi\$ measurements on argon.
  * (Possibly mention other efforts: NOMAD and CHORUS in the 90s (higher energy, DIS regime), if relevant, or the COHERENT experiment for coherent elastic \$\nu\$-nucleus scattering at very low energy – though that’s a different regime.)

  We emphasize how each experiment balanced *flux uncertainties* (often a dominant systematic) with detector systematics. For example, MINERvA benefited from a well-characterized beam and external hadron production data to constrain flux. T2K used its near detector to *in situ* constrain the flux via measurements of neutrino interactions in different subdetectors. As a result, recent cross-section data are much more detailed – providing double-differential distributions and covering specific final states (like “CC1\$\pi^+\$ on oxygen”). We conclude by noting the synergy: these measurements inform generator tuning and reduce uncertainties for future oscillation experiments. A short discussion covers how new data revealed issues in models (e.g. the “low-\$Q^2\$ deficit” in pion production models, or differences in proton multiplicities). This historical perspective sets the stage for focusing on detectors and DUNE’s approach in subsequent days.

* **Discussion Prompt:** **“Flux Challenges.”** We discuss in class: How do experiments determine the neutrino flux (required to get absolute cross sections)? Students should understand methods like hadron production data (for accelerator beams), in situ calibrations (e.g. \$ν\$-\$e\$ scattering), and why sometimes ratio measurements (cross section on nucleus A vs nucleus B) are advantageous to cancel flux uncertainties. This highlights a practical aspect of turning detector counts into physics cross sections.

### Day 8: Detector Technologies and Reconstruction Challenges

* **Topics:** Overview of common neutrino detectors used in cross-section measurements – **Liquid Argon Time Projection Chambers (LAr TPCs)**, **Water Cherenkov detectors**, **Scintillator tracking detectors** – and how their characteristics affect cross-section measurement. Challenges in event reconstruction: missing energy (neutrons), particle identification (muon vs pion), threshold effects, and detector resolutions. The impact of final-state interactions (FSI) and how detectors observe them.
* **Learning Objectives:**

  * Learn the operating principles of major detector types (LAr TPC, water Cherenkov, scintillator bar or straw-tube tracker) and what kind of interaction information they provide (e.g. LAr gives 3D tracks and calorimetry; Cherenkov gives ring images of leptons).
  * Understand specific reconstruction challenges: e.g. detecting neutrons or low-energy protons (which can be below Cherenkov threshold in water, or have short range in LAr), distinguishing charged-current from neutral-current events, measuring neutrino energy when part of the hadronic energy is undetected.
  * Appreciate how detector choice and design can influence the systematic uncertainties of cross-section measurements (for instance, a high-resolution LAr TPC can measure proton kinematics which helps identify QE vs RES).
* **Lecture Content:** This session is a practical complement to Day 7, focusing on the *experimental techniques*. We describe:

  * **Liquid Argon TPCs (e.g. MicroBooNE, DUNE ND and FD):** Working principle of drifting ionization charge in LAr, providing fine-grained 3D images. Strengths: low threshold for charged particles (keV-scale), ability to see short proton tracks and even recoil protons from neutrons (via scattered protons). Challenges: huge data volume, requiring sophisticated algorithms (e.g. Pandora) to reconstruct events; need for calibration (e.g. electric field uniformity, recombination corrections). LAr is excellent for exclusive final states (separating 1p0π vs 1p1π, etc.), which is why DUNE ND will utilize it.
  * **Water Cherenkov (e.g. Super-K, T2K’s far detector, and proposed Intermediate Water Cherenkov):** Operating principle of Cherenkov radiation and ring imaging. Strengths: very large masses possible (good for oscillation far detectors, not to mention discovery of oscillations happened in such detectors), well-understood for relatively simple topologies (one muon ring for CCQE). Weaknesses: high particle detection threshold (\~MeV for electrons, \~Cherenkov threshold \$\beta>0.75\$ for protons means protons below \~1 GeV/c are often unseen), inability to see neutrons or slow protons, and difficulties with complex topologies (multiple rings overlap). This means a lot of hadronic activity is “invisible” – experiments report “CC0π” in water where it really means “no pion above threshold, and we ignore nucleons”.
  * **Scintillator Trackers (e.g. MINERvA’s scintillator planes, NOvA’s detectors, T2K ND280’s plastic scintillator + TPC system):** These detectors use plastic scintillator (hydrocarbon) often with embedded wavelength-shifting fibers and PMTs, providing 2D hit maps and sometimes 3D tracking when combined with multi-angle placement or TPCs (ND280 has actual TPCs for momentum and dE/dx). Strengths: decent granularity, can be magnetized (T2K ND280 has a 0.2 T field, allowing sign selection and momentum measurement of muons), and scintillator provides timing information. Challenges: moderate threshold (\~tens of MeV; can see protons above \~50 MeV kinetic energy as a few cm of track), still cannot measure neutrons except via secondary interactions, and coarse granularity might merge tracks.
  * **Magnetized Iron Calorimeters (e.g. MINOS ND/FD):** mentioned for completeness – these measure muons well (with magnetized iron giving muon momentum via curvature) but have poor hadron visualization.

  We then discuss reconstruction: converting raw signals to kinematic quantities. We emphasize how neutrino energy \$E\_\nu\$ is reconstructed: for CC events, \$E\_\nu = E\_\mu + E\_{\text{had}}\$. If neutrons carry away energy unseen, or if energy exits the detector, \$E\_\nu\$ is underestimated. This is a big issue for cross-section results as well as oscillation analysis. We give an example: in a LAr TPC, a neutron can produce a proton far from vertex, which might be missed by pattern recognition; in a WC detector, the neutron is completely invisible except for a delayed capture gamma sometimes. So, final states that differ only by neutral particles are hard to distinguish. We also cover how FSI complicate interpretation: e.g. if a pion is produced but absorbed, the detector sees a QE-like event; experiments combat this by unfolding to “true” interaction categories using generator models, but as discussed, this introduces model dependence.

  A case study is presented: MicroBooNE’s measurement of \$\nu\_\mu\$ CC0π on argon. The detector could see protons down to \~50 MeV; they included events with 0 or 1 proton in final state above threshold. We discuss how they calibrated energy for protons (using \$dE/dx\$ to get kinetic energy) and how they accounted for neutrons (which often produce undetected or late signals). Another example: T2K ND280 measured \$\nu\$ on water vs carbon by installing water-filled modules that can be alternated empty/full. The clever use of two targets allowed isolating interactions on water by subtraction, demonstrating how experimental techniques can isolate cross sections on specific nuclei.

  By the end, students should appreciate that every detector has blind spots and systematic uncertainties – whether it’s missing energy, particle mis-identification, or acceptance – and careful calibration and analysis are needed to extract true cross sections. This understanding motivates why DUNE is adopting multiple detector technologies in its near detector suite.

* **Activity:** We show event display images (if available) from different detectors (e.g. a beautiful MicroBooNE LAr event vs a Super-K Cherenkov ring image) and ask students to point out features relevant to cross-section analysis. For example: “In this LAr event, can you identify the proton track and muon? What does the intensity of hits tell us?” or “In this Cherenkov image, how would an additional proton manifest (if at all)?” This visual exercise reinforces how we glean physics from detector signals.

### Day 9: Neutrino Cross Sections and the DUNE Experiment

* **Topics:** The strategy of the upcoming DUNE experiment for neutrino interaction uncertainties: DUNE Near Detector suite and cross-section measurements on argon; using near detector data to constrain far detector predictions; expected improvements in cross-section knowledge (e.g. percent-level measurements); specific challenges for DUNE’s energy range (\~GeV to few GeV, transition region).
* **Learning Objectives:**

  * Understand the design of the DUNE Near Detector (ND) and how each component contributes to interaction measurements: ND-LAr (liquid argon TPC), ND-GAr (high-pressure gas argon TPC + magnet for spectrometry), and SAND (on-axis detector with tracker) – if applicable.
  * Learn how DUNE will use near detector data not just to measure the neutrino flux, but also to *measure cross sections on argon* to reduce model uncertainties.
  * Discuss how precise cross-section knowledge feeds into the DUNE oscillation analysis (e.g. controlling systematics for CP violation search) and what level of uncertainty is aimed for.
* **Lecture Content:** We frame this session around DUNE as a capstone example where all prior aspects come together (theory, generators, detectors, analysis):

  * **DUNE ND Overview:** DUNE’s ND is actually a complex of detectors. We describe ND-LAr, essentially a miniature DUNE far detector, to directly measure \$\nu\$-Ar interactions in the same target as FD. Then ND-GAr (also called MPD – multi-purpose detector), which is a magnetized gas TPC surrounded by an ECAL – this can measure muon momentum with high precision and lower density allows separation of overlapping events and detection of neutrons (via gas-based recoil detection). SAND (a permanent on-axis detector with a 3D scintillator tracker and magnet) monitors the beam continuously. The ND can move off-axis (DUNE-PRISM concept) to sample different neutrino energy spectra, helping to untangle cross-section vs flux effects.
  * **Cross-Section Constraints:** We emphasize that DUNE’s long-baseline oscillation program *demands* a tight handle on interaction systematics. The ND will be used to **constrain the cross-section model** employed in analyses. For example, by fitting ND data, DUNE will tune GENIE (or whatever generator) parameters such that predictions at the far detector are reliable. This includes measuring absolute cross sections on argon for various final states (CC0π, CC1π, etc.) with high statistics.
  * We discuss what new information DUNE ND might provide: With large statistics, it can map out differential cross sections on argon with percent-level precision, possibly revealing subtle effects (e.g. detailed spectral function features, or final-state correlations). Also, DUNE’s energy range (peaking \~2.5 GeV) sits in a complex transition region (mix of RES and DIS) – DUNE ND data can help refine how generators handle this region by providing high-statistics DIS-on-argon data for the first time.
  * **Example Projections:** If available (from CDR or studies), we mention projected uncertainties: e.g. DUNE aims to constrain overall interaction uncertainties to the few-percent level, which is needed to not dominate the oscillation error budget. We might illustrate how a certain cross-section parameter (say \$M\_A\$ or 2p2h normalization) could be pinned down by ND measurements of muon kinematics and proton multiplicities.
  * We also note DUNE’s potential for *additional* cross-section physics: e.g. it will detect thousands of \$\nu\_\tau\$ appearance events (thus provide data on \$\nu\_\tau\$ cross sections which are least known), and its high-energy tail sees neutrinos up to tens of GeV, contributing to \$\nu\$-Ar DIS data.

  Finally, the lecture touches on how the global community will benefit: DUNE ND measurements on argon will be complementary to T2K (carbon, oxygen) and MINERvA (carbon, iron, lead) results, helping to build a universal picture. As a summary, we reflect on the broader picture: *Knowing neutrino-nucleus cross sections precisely is essential for the success of oscillation experiments*, and DUNE is poised to push this knowledge frontier on argon.

* **Capstone Project (Optional):** *“Design a Cross-Section Analysis for DUNE ND.”* As a multi-day project or take-home assignment, students (in small groups) propose a measurement using DUNE’s near detector. For example, measure the \$\nu\_\mu\$ CCQE-like differential cross section on argon. They should outline: what detector data to use (LAr or GAr), how to select the sample, how to handle backgrounds (e.g. \$\pi\$ production looking like QE), and what systematic uncertainties they expect (flux, detector, model). This exercise synthesizes the course content – requiring understanding of theory (what is QE-like), generators (for selection and background estimation), and detector capabilities. It can be presented or discussed on Day 10.

### Day 10: Synthesis and Future Directions (Optional)

* **Topics:** Synthesis of key takeaways; open questions in neutrino cross sections; future improvements in theory (effective field theory, *ab initio* nuclear calculations, Lattice QCD inputs for form factors), and future experiments (e.g. Hyper-Kamiokande ND280 upgrade, NA61/SHINE for hadron production, IceCube-Upgrade for high-energy cross sections).
* **Learning Objectives:**

  * Summarize the interdependence of theory, generator, and experiment in neutrino cross-section research.
  * Identify at least three current *open problems*: e.g. the precise value and \$Q^2\$-dependence of the nucleon axial form factor, modeling of multi-nucleon (2p2h) contributions, or discrepancies in neutrino vs electron scattering comparisons.
  * Gain a forward-looking perspective on how the field might evolve, preparing students to contribute to future advances (whether in theoretical modeling or experimental analysis).
* **Lecture Content:** In this closing session, we revisit the overarching motivation: accurate neutrino cross sections underpin the success of neutrino physics. We recap each part of the course in a few sentences, reinforcing how Part I (theory) feeds Part II (generators), which are validated by Part III (experiments). Key synthesis points:

  * Many recent improvements have come from *better theory and data collaboration*. For instance, theorists developing superscaling (SuSA) or spectral function models and experiments providing data that validate or challenge these models.
  * Yet, some puzzles remain. We list a few: e.g. the “MINERvA vs model” discrepancy in the recoil energy distributions (indicating perhaps missing processes in generators), or the tension between bubble chamber measurements and modern nuclear-target measurements for QE (in part resolved by 2p2h but not completely).
  * We discuss how future calculations might reduce uncertainties: Lattice QCD is poised to compute the nucleon axial form factor with increasing precision, which will constrain \$F\_A(Q^2)\$ input to generators. Nuclear many-body theory (using *ab initio* methods or effective field theory) might eventually allow first-principles calculations of \$\nu\$–nucleus cross sections for light nuclei (oxygen, carbon) – providing benchmarks for generator tuning.
  * On the experimental side, we highlight upcoming efforts: The SBN program at Fermilab (SBND and ICARUS) will produce more \$\nu\$-Ar cross-section data before DUNE. T2K and MINERvA are refining their analyses and perhaps final combined datasets. Hyper-Kamiokande’s new Intermediate Water Cherenkov detector with a muon range detector will improve cross sections on oxygen. In the high-energy realm, IceCube and accelerator beam dump experiments may extend knowledge of \$\nu\$ cross sections to the TeV scale (e.g. \$\nu\_\tau\$ appearance and cross section measurements).
  * Lastly, we emphasize the collaborative nature of this field: progress requires input from nuclear physics, particle physics, and computational tools. Students are encouraged to stay updated through workshops like the *NuINT* conference series and to contribute to open-source generator projects or analysis of public data.

* **Final Q\&A / Discussion:** We conclude with an open discussion, inviting questions on any topic from the course. For example, *“How would a 1% precision in cross sections impact the error on the leptonic CP phase measurement?”* or *“What aspects of neutrino generators would you improve if you were to develop GENIE v4?”* – prompting students to think critically and integrate what they’ve learned. This also gives the instructor feedback on which areas students found most challenging or intriguing.

---

**Course Wrap-Up:** By the end of this course, students will have a comprehensive understanding of neutrino cross sections from theory through simulation to experiment. They will be equipped to read current research literature on neutrino interaction measurements (e.g. DUNE near detector papers) and to contribute to future efforts, whether it be improving a neutrino generator or analyzing data for cross-section extraction. The interplay of quantum field theory, nuclear physics, and experimental techniques highlighted in this course exemplifies the multi-disciplinary skill set required in modern neutrino physics. Each student should now appreciate that precise neutrino cross-section knowledge is not *just* an auxiliary detail but a cornerstone of the entire neutrino oscillation program and a rich field of study on its own.
