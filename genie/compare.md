# Comparative Analysis of Neutrino Event Generators: GENIE, NEUT, NuWro, and GiBUU

## Introduction

Neutrino event generators are essential tools in neutrino physics, bridging theoretical models and experimental data by simulating neutrino interactions with nuclei. Four major generators are commonly used today: **GENIE**, **NEUT**, **NuWro**, and **GiBUU**. Each provides a comprehensive simulation of neutrino-nucleus interactions but with different physics modeling choices and design philosophies. GENIE is the most widely adopted (serving as the default in many Fermilab-led experiments) and is developed by a large collaboration. NEUT is primarily used by the T2K/Super-Kamiokande/Hyper-Kamiokande collaborations, maintained by a smaller team and tailored to those experiments’ needs. NuWro is a neutrino generator from the Wrocław group with a strong theory focus, offering many model options but developed by only a few people. GiBUU (Giessen Boltzmann–Uehling–Uhlenbeck) is fundamentally a transport-model-based generator with a distinct approach; it is extremely physics-rich but maintained by a very small team and not as straightforwardly integrated into experimental workflows.

All four generators cover a broad range of interaction processes: quasi-elastic lepton scattering, multi-nucleon (2p2h/MEC) excitations, resonance production, deep inelastic scattering (DIS), coherent pion production, and final-state interactions (FSI) of produced hadrons. In the following sections, we compare these generators in terms of their **physics model implementations** (for each process category), their validity across **energy ranges** (from sub-GeV to multi-GeV), their **agreement with key experimental data**, and various **practical considerations** (speed, flexibility, usability, support). We then summarize the relative advantages and disadvantages of each generator in both physics fidelity and practical usage.

## Physics Model Implementations

**Overview:** Table 1 provides a high-level comparison of the physics models used in GENIE, NEUT, NuWro, and GiBUU for each major interaction category. The subsequent text highlights these differences in detail.

Historically, GENIE used an effective axial mass (M<sub>A</sub>) \~1.2–1.3 GeV (higher than world-average 1.03 GeV) to emulate nuclear effects and match MiniBooNE data. Newer GENIE versions incorporate the Nieves *RPA* (Random Phase Approximation) suppression of QE and 2p2h enhancements as an option, as well as alternative form-factor models (e.g. \$z\$-expansion). Nuclear recoil and Fermi motion are handled via the chosen nuclear model (e.g. RFG).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Uses the same Llewellyn-Smith QE formalism with dipole form factors. NEUT historically set M<sub>A</sub>≈1.2 GeV by default to better fit measurements. Recent NEUT versions include the Nieves *RPA* corrections (suppressing QE at low \$Q^2\$) consistent with nuclear many-body calculations. By default NEUT employs a local Fermi gas for the initial nucleon momentum, but an optional spectral function can be used for QE to better reproduce nucleon removal energy and momentum distributions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Also employs the Llewellyn-Smith QE cross-section formula. NuWro allows adjustable axial mass and includes RPA corrections based on Nieves’s model (user can toggle these). It was among the first to test the “Transverse Enhancement” (TE) idea – boosting magnetic form factors to mimic 2p2h effects – before full MEC implementations.

GiBUU uses the standard QE matrix element (similar to Llewellyn-Smith) but with **no ad-hoc parameter tuning** – it uses the free-nucleon axial mass \~1.0 GeV and includes nuclear effects (Pauli blocking, binding energy, nucleon off-shellness) directly. Long-range correlations (RPA) are not explicitly applied as a separate factor; however, the mean-field potential and in-medium modifications inherently reduce the QE cross-section at low \$Q^2\$, qualitatively similar to RPA suppression. GiBUU’s QE predictions have generally aligned with old bubble-chamber data “out of the box,” though they fell below the higher MiniBooNE QE-like data (indicating the need for 2p2h, see below).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| **2p2h / Meson-Exchange Current (MEC)** (multi-nucleon interactions beyond simple QE)                       | GENIE originally lacked explicit 2p2h; an *empirical MEC* model (“transverse enhancement”) was later added to boost the cross-section in a way tuned to MiniBooNE transverse observables. In the GENIE v3 series, a full *Valencia 2p2h* model (Nieves *et al.*, 2013) is implemented, which adds genuine 2p2h processes (neutrino scattering on correlated \$np\$ pairs) with both CC and NC contributions. Users can choose between the empirical approach and the microscopic Valencia model. These MEC contributions, together with RPA, allow GENIE to reproduce measured QE-like spectra (with no need for unrealistically high M<sub>A</sub>).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | NEUT has incorporated similar multi-nucleon (2p2h) physics in recent years. It now includes the Valencia 2p2h model (consistent with its use of Nieves RPA for QE) so that multi-nucleon knockout contributions are simulated. An older model by Marteau (based on nuclear response functions) was available in NEUT for CCQE-like enhancement, but the Valencia model has become the preferred choice. NEUT tunes the overall 2p2h normalizations to T2K data. These additions have improved NEUT’s agreement with QE-like observables in T2K and MiniBooNE.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | NuWro introduced MEC effects early via an empirical enhancement of the transverse cross-section (TE model) to fit MiniBooNE data. More recently, NuWro has implemented full microscopic 2p2h models: e.g. coupling to 2p2h response functions from electron-scattering (some developments involve the SuSAv2 model and others). The upcoming NuWro versions include state-of-the-art spectral function and 2p2h for argon and other targets. In summary, NuWro offers MEC modeling but with flexibility – one can run with or without 2p2h, or test different model inputs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | GiBUU initially did not include a separate MEC channel – it treated only QE, resonance, and DIS – which led to underprediction of MiniBooNE’s QE-like cross-section (since that data included multi-nucleon events). In current versions, GiBUU **has added a 2p2h/MEC component** to the cross-section, informed by electron-nucleus scattering data. This is implemented by enhancing the transverse nuclear response in the model (following e-scattering measurements of two-nucleon knockout). Additionally, GiBUU naturally produces multi-nucleon emission final states through FSI (e.g. Delta resonance absorption can emit two nucleons, mimicking MEC events in the final state). Thus, GiBUU now accounts for MEC both implicitly via FSI and explicitly via a 2p2h cross-section term, improving its agreement with QE-like neutrino data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| **Resonance (RES) Production** (single-pion production on nucleon resonances)                               | GENIE simulates resonance production (typically for hadronic invariant mass \$W \lesssim 1.7\$ GeV) using the Rein–Sehgal model for baryon resonances. It includes an explicit \$\Delta(1232)\$ resonance and several higher resonances (e.g. \$N^*(1440)\$, \$N^*(1535)\$, etc.), with helicity amplitudes from Rein-Sehgal. Non-resonant backgrounds in the one-pion channel are added (GENIE uses a duality-inspired approach, extending DIS model into the resonance region to account for non-resonant single-pion events). In v3, form factors and kinematics were updated; e.g. an option for the Berger–Sehgal model (which corrects Rein–Sehgal by including lepton mass effects and updated resonance properties) is provided. By default, GENIE includes interference between resonant and non-resonant amplitudes in an effective way (via tuned weights) rather than fully coherent amplitude calculations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | NEUT also uses the Rein–Sehgal model for resonance production. The \$\Delta(1232)\$ is handled with Rein-Sehgal’s angular distribution; for higher resonances, NEUT historically treated pion angular distributions as isotropic in the resonance rest frame (a simplification). NEUT includes 16 resonant channels up to about 2 GeV in \$W\$. Non-resonant background is added similarly to GENIE (based on duality-inspired tuning). NEUT’s model was tuned to old bubble chamber data for single pion production on light nuclei. Recent improvements have focused on better coherence between resonant and non-resonant contributions and updated form factors for the \$\Delta\$ resonance (to match modern data).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | NuWro’s resonance region model is similar in spirit. It includes the \$\Delta(1232)\$ resonance and higher \$N^\*\$ states using Rein–Sehgal or other empirical models, with adjustable parameters. By default NuWro generates resonant pion production with Rein-Sehgal cross sections (including non-resonant background from the Bodek-Yang model when \$W\$ is below the DIS threshold). It allows modifications – e.g. using updated resonance widths or form factors – reflecting its theory-driven flexibility. In practice, NuWro’s default predictions for one-pion production are comparable to GENIE/NEUT in overall normalization, with differences arising from how the non-resonant terms are tuned.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | GiBUU treats resonance production in a more explicit coupled-channel manner. It includes a range of baryon resonances (up to at least the \$\Delta(1232)\$ and several higher resonances) which are excited in the initial neutrino–nucleon interaction. The resonance excitations and non-resonant background (direct DIS-like pion production) are **handled within the same transport framework** – GiBUU’s cross section is computed as \$\sigma\_{\text{tot}} = \sigma\_{QE} + \sigma\_{RES} + \sigma\_{BG} + \sigma\_{DIS}\$. In the region \$W\sim1.5\$–2 GeV, GiBUU assumes contributions from resonances, background, and DIS overlap and transitions smoothly. It calculates interference between resonant and non-resonant pion production channels intrinsically by solving the quantum kinetic equations for the hadronic excitations. This means GiBUU does not need to *force* continuity between resonance and DIS regions – the model naturally interpolates, and resonances gradually give way to DIS as energy increases. As a result, GiBUU often yields more moderate pion yields in the resonance–DIS overlapping region, and it can predict more detailed final-state characteristics (since each resonance decay and interaction is handled in the transport simulation).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| **Deep Inelastic Scattering (DIS)** (high-\$W\$ inelastic interactions producing multi-hadron final states) | At high invariant mass or neutrino energy (typically \$W \gtrsim 1.8\$ GeV), GENIE uses a DIS model based on parton distribution functions (PDFs) and PYTHIA for hadronization. It employs Bodek–Yang modifications to GRV98 PDFs at moderate \$Q^2\$ to better fit neutrino data, and then calls **PYTHIA 6** to fragment the struck nucleon’s quarks into hadrons. GENIE thus delegates multi-hadron production to an external hadronization model, with tuning to hadron multiplicity data where available. Nuclear effects in DIS (shadowing at low \$x\$, EMC effect at mid-\$x\$) have historically been *neglected or approximated* in GENIE, meaning it treats the nucleon as quasi-free for DIS. (In GENIE v3, optional nuclear PDFs or shadowing corrections can be applied, but these are not yet standard.)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | NEUT’s DIS implementation is similar. It uses the GRV98 (leading-order) PDF set for nucleon structure functions and applies corrections (like Bodek-Yang scaling) in the transition region. Hadronization is handled by the **JETSET/PYTHIA** algorithm: when a neutrino interaction is classified as DIS, NEUT calls an internal hadronization routine equivalent to PYTHIA to generate the multi-particle final state (pions, kaons, nucleons, etc.). NEUT does not explicitly simulate nuclear shadowing or anti-shadowing; at very high energies (tens of GeV and above) it can be used up to \$\sim\$TeV scales, but users must be aware that heavy-nucleus DIS data (like EMC effect) are not deeply built into the model. In practice, for energies relevant to T2K and MINERvA (few GeV), NEUT’s DIS piece mainly matters for the higher tail of the neutrino spectrum.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | NuWro also uses parton model cross sections for DIS, combined with hadronization via PYTHIA6 or its own Lund-string routines. By default, NuWro requires a hadronic invariant mass \$W>1.6\$ GeV to call DIS; below that, events are handled as resonance or non-resonant single-pion events. It includes nuclear PDF effects optionally – for example, one can input nuclear structure functions if desired. Notably, NuWro (as of recent versions) includes a *hadron formation zone* parameter: hadrons produced in DIS are given a formation length (no FSI within that length) to mimic quantum effects of hadronization in nuclear matter. This affects how FSI are handled for DIS events and is an example of NuWro’s detailed options.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | In GiBUU, DIS is treated as another channel in the unified framework. When a neutrino interacts at high \$W\$, GiBUU uses nucleon PDFs (often the same PDF sets like those in PYTHIA) to get the cross-section, and then **calls PYTHIA** to generate the hadronic final state. Crucially, GiBUU applies **nuclear corrections to DIS structure functions**: it can use nuclear-modified PDFs or reduce the initial nucleon momentum distribution for shadowing effects. The neutrino sees a bound nucleon with Fermi motion and binding; GiBUU ensures energy–momentum is conserved including the nuclear potential. The resulting hadrons from PYTHIA are then handed to the transport system. Thus, every hadron produced in the DIS event will propagate outwards and potentially re-interact in the nucleus. GiBUU is unique in that it *explicitly* accounts for medium effects on DIS (e.g. shadowing) and then follows the fate of each outgoing hadron, providing a very complete simulation of high-energy interactions in a nucleus.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| **Coherent Pion Production** (interaction with the entire nucleus leaving it intact)                        | GENIE includes neutrino coherent pion production via the Rein–Sehgal coherent model (1983) as default. This model uses a PCAC (Partially Conserved Axial Current) approach to treat the nucleus as a whole and predict coherent \$\pi\$ production off the nuclear target. GENIE corrected this model for lepton mass effects and modified nuclear form factors, and later added the Berger–Sehgal 2009 model as an alternative. The Berger–Sehgal model incorporates updated PCAC and meson decay constants and tends to predict lower cross-sections at low energies. GENIE also has an implementation of microscopic coherent models by Alvarez-Ruso *et al.* (2007), which can be enabled for comparison. By default, GENIE’s coherent channel is tuned to Rein-Sehgal (with adjustments to match data).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | NEUT’s coherent pion model has historically been Rein–Sehgal as well, with modifications to account for the finite lepton mass and updated experimental inputs. NEUT was used to simulate coherent \$\pi\$ production in water and hydrocarbon; it typically predicted a relatively low cross-section at T2K energies, consistent with the non-observation in MiniBooNE and consistent with T2K’s later measurement. Alternative models (e.g. those by Kartavtsev or Alvarez-Ruso) have been tested against NEUT – T2K’s 2017 coherent \$\pi\$ analysis, for instance, compared NEUT (Rein-Sehgal) to those models. NEUT’s current default remains a PCAC-based model normalized to data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | NuWro uses the Berger–Sehgal updated coherent pion model by default, which tends to give a more realistic energy dependence for the cross-section (especially important for \$E\_\nu \sim 1\$ GeV). The user can choose the older Rein–Sehgal model for comparison. NuWro’s coherent predictions have been compared extensively with data from MINERvA and T2K; it often yields results similar to GENIE’s updated model. Because of its flexibility, one can adjust the nuclear form factor or other coherence parameters in NuWro to evaluate uncertainties.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | GiBUU **does not explicitly simulate coherent pion production** as a separate process. Its design is to have the neutrino interact with individual nucleons, not the nucleus collectively. Thus, what we call “coherent \$\pi\$” (where the nucleus remains in the ground state) is not generated by GiBUU’s primary interaction model. However, GiBUU could produce events **indistinguishable from coherent** if, for example, a \$\Delta\$ is excited on one nucleon and the ensuing pion leaves the nucleus without causing breakup. In such a case GiBUU’s final state would show an intact nucleus and a pion – effectively a coherent-like outcome. But the true coherent amplitude (where the nucleus as a whole is the target) is absent. As a result, GiBUU tends to underestimate coherent pion production – one would need to externally add a coherent channel for complete coverage.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| **Final-State Interactions (FSI)** (hadron transport through the nucleus)                                   | A crucial part of GENIE is its FSI treatment – once a hadron (nucleon, pion, etc.) is produced at the interaction vertex, it can rescatter or be absorbed in the nucleus before exiting. GENIE offers two FSI models: an older empirical model (hA2018) and a more detailed intranuclear cascade (hN2018). The **empirical hA model** uses an effective hadron–nucleus cross-section approach: each hadron is given a fate (absorb, charge-exchange, scatter) based on probabilities tuned to data. This model is fast and was the GENIE default in v2. In v3, the **hN cascade** (based on INTRANUKE code) is available, which steps hadrons through nuclear matter and simulates interactions with nucleons stochastically (similar to a Geant4 cascade). It uses free hadron–nucleon cross sections with some medium corrections and Pauli blocking. While more physically detailed than hA, the cascade is slower. Both models are semi-classical and **do not include nuclear mean-field potentials** – hadrons travel in straight lines between collisions. GENIE’s FSI parameters (interaction probabilities, mean free paths) are tuned to external data like \$\pi\$–Carbon cross sections. Overall, GENIE can reasonably reproduce hadron attenuation and pion absorption fractions on various targets, but it treats FSI in a simplified, factorized way (first hadron production, then FSI as a separate step). | NEUT uses an **intranuclear cascade** model for FSI that is quite detailed and has been refined over decades. When a pion, nucleon, or kaon is produced in NEUT, it propagates through the nucleus divided into concentric shells (to simulate density variations). At each step, the hadron can interact according to measured cross sections (NEUT relies on data for \$\pi N\$ scattering, \$\pi\$ absorption, \$NN\$ interactions, etc., with modifications for the nuclear medium). The model originates from Oset and Salcedo’s theoretical work on pion propagation in nuclei. It includes pion absorption (e.g. \$π + N N \to N N\$), charge exchange (\$π^+ n \to π^0 p\$, etc.), and elastic scattering with Pauli blocking for nucleon final states. FSI for nucleons includes elastic re-scattering and emission of secondary nucleons. NEUT’s cascade has been tuned to reproduce hadronic data on carbon, oxygen, iron, etc. Medium corrections (like the nuclear optical potential) are effectively included by adjusting cross sections and collision rates. NEUT does not include an explicit nuclear potential for outgoing particles, but the cascade effectively stops low-energy secondaries, simulating binding. Overall, NEUT’s FSI is similar in spirit to GENIE’s cascade option and gives comparable outcomes; differences appear in details like the exact absorption rates and nucleon knockout probabilities, which each generator tunes independently. | NuWro also uses an **intranuclear cascade** for FSI. Hadrons produced at the interaction vertex propagate and undergo possible collisions in the nucleus. NuWro’s cascade is somewhat simpler by default (given its lightweight design) but includes the key physics: Pauli blocking for nucleon re-scattering, a formation zone (hadrons travel an initial distance without interaction to account for the quantum formation time), and interactions like pion absorption and re-scattering. The probabilities are derived from hadron–nucleon cross sections. One particularity is that NuWro allows turning FSI off or modifying it easily for comparisons; for example, one can run “transparent nucleus” to see the impact of FSI on observables. By comparing NuWro with and without FSI, users have illustrated how much FSI affects outgoing pion and proton distributions. In terms of results, NuWro’s FSI predictions are broadly in line with those of GENIE/NEUT for a given set of cross-section inputs. Its strength lies in easy adjustability (one can test different FSI scenarios), though by default it may not be as rigorously tuned to data as GENIE/NEUT’s (since those have large experimental user bases to refine FSI parameters). | GiBUU’s handling of FSI is the **most sophisticated** of these generators. Rather than a separate step after event generation, FSI in GiBUU is part of a unified theoretical framework: GiBUU *propagates the hadronic particles in the nuclear medium using the Boltzmann-Uehling-Uhlenbeck (BUU) transport equation*. Each particle (nucleon, pion, kaon, etc.) is represented by a phase-space distribution and is propagated in time through a nuclear mean-field potential. The BUU equation handles both the continuous evolution under the mean field and collisions between particles. Collisions (scatterings, absorption, decays) are simulated with cross-sections and interaction probabilities, similar to a cascade but coupled with the mean field. This approach inherently includes nuclear binding and Fermi motion during FSI: for instance, a nucleon can be slowed or kept inside the nucleus by the potential. It also means that interference effects and coupled channels (e.g. \$\Delta\$ propagation and decay to \$\pi N\$ inside the nucleus) are treated dynamically. In practice, GiBUU FSI predictions have been very successful in explaining hadron spectra in inclusive reactions. The downside is that it is computationally intensive – essentially solving a differential equation for each event’s particles. The result, however, is a very high-fidelity simulation of FSI: it can predict not only how many pions are absorbed, but also distributions of their energies, angular correlations of knocked-out nucleons, etc., in a way cascades must approximate. No other neutrino event generator explicitly solves transport equations for FSI; they instead use static cascades. This is a key differentiator of GiBUU’s physics fidelity. |

### Summary of Model Differences

In summary, all four generators simulate the **same set of processes** but with important model differences. GENIE, NEUT, and NuWro share a broadly similar physics menu – rooted in the impulse approximation (neutrino interacts with one nucleon at a time) with add-ons for multi-nucleon effects and with hadron transport via intranuclear cascades. GiBUU, by contrast, aims for a more fundamental description by combining initial interaction and FSI in one transport framework, albeit at the cost of simplicity and speed.

Key distinctions include the **nuclear initial state** modeling (GENIE/NEUT often using Fermi gas models vs. GiBUU using a realistic potential, and the availability of spectral function options in NEUT/NuWro), the handling of **QE and 2p2h** (where all generators now include some form of multi-nucleon enhancement, but GiBUU was slower to include an explicit MEC channel), and the approach to **FSI** (simple cascade in GENIE/NEUT/NuWro vs. full transport in GiBUU).

Notably, by 2025 all generators have evolved significantly from a decade ago – GENIE and NEUT have integrated many nuclear theory improvements (RPA, spectral functions, MEC), and NuWro has served as a testbed for new models. GiBUU remains the most theoretically complete, treating the nucleus in a self-consistent way, which often yields more accurate micro-physics (at the expense of user-friendliness). On the other hand, GENIE’s **universality** is a strength: it spans energies from MeV to TeV and all targets with a single configurable framework, whereas GiBUU is optimized for medium energies (up to tens of GeV) and has limited usage beyond that.

The table and discussion above provide a detailed comparative look at each process. We will next consider how these differences manifest across varying neutrino energies and how well each generator’s predictions agree with experimental data.

## Treatment Across Energy Ranges (sub-GeV to multi-GeV)

A good neutrino generator must accurately cover energies from the sub-GeV scale (relevant for oscillation experiments and nuclear physics studies) to multi-GeV or tens of GeV (relevant for long-baseline beams and some cross-section measurements), and even to the 100 GeV–TeV scale for atmospheric and accelerator neutrinos. Table 2 summarizes the nominal energy coverage of each generator.

**Table 2: Nominal Energy Coverage of the Generators**

| Generator | Energy Range Coverage                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **GENIE** | \~1 MeV to PeV scale (validated from 10’s MeV up to multi-TeV). Designed for **universal use from MeV to PeV** energies. Commonly used in few-hundred MeV (e.g. MiniBooNE) to few-10s GeV (MINERvA, NOvA) domains, and extended to 100s GeV–TeV for cosmic/neutrino telescope applications.                                               |
| **NEUT**  | \~O(10 MeV) to \~TeV scale. Originally developed for sub-GeV to few-GeV (Kamiokande, K2K), later extended for atmospheric neutrinos up to 100’s of GeV. Capable of simulating neutrinos “from tens of MeV to a few TeV”. Mainly validated in the 0.1–10 GeV range (T2K, SK), with DIS models allowing higher-energy use.                  |
| **NuWro** | \~100 MeV to O(10 GeV)+. Aimed at GeV-scale accelerator neutrinos; covers up to at least tens of GeV. (No hard-coded upper limit; uses PDF-based DIS so can, in principle, go to very high energy, but it’s less utilized for > 50 GeV.) Primarily used and tested in the \~0.2–5 GeV range (MINERvA, T2K comparisons).                   |
| **GiBUU** | \~200 MeV to \~20–30 GeV. GiBUU’s transport model was initially for 0.1–few GeV; later versions incorporate DIS to reach the tens-of-GeV range. It has been validated against data up to \~20 GeV (MINOS, NOMAD). Not typically used for ultra-high energies (>100 GeV) due to computational intensity and lack of tuning in that regime. |

Despite overlapping coverage, there are **differences in how each handles the extremes**:

* **Sub-GeV (100’s of MeV)**: At these energies, nuclear structure and collective effects (like giant resonances or very low-\$Q^2\$ scattering) can be important. NEUT and GENIE both can simulate interactions down to tens of MeV (e.g. solar or supernova neutrinos interactions), including charged-current inverse beta decay and nuclear de-excitation photons, etc. NEUT in particular was used for Super-Kamiokande atmospheric neutrinos in the 100 MeV–1 GeV range and is tested in that domain. GENIE is also used for near-threshold simulations (e.g. in reactor neutrino contexts or for upcoming low-energy experiments) and includes some specialized nuclear transitions for <100 MeV. GiBUU can naturally handle low energies as it was originally a model for proton/nucleon-induced reactions in the 100 MeV scale; however, its complexity makes it less practical for huge Monte Carlo samples at very low energies.

* **Few GeV (1–5 GeV)**: All four generators are extensively used and tested here. This range has a mix of QE, 2p2h, resonance, and DIS processes. **T2K (0.6 GeV peak)** and **MiniBooNE (0.8 GeV)** operate in this regime’s lower end, while **MINERvA (3 GeV peak)** and **NOvA (2 GeV)** are in the upper end. GENIE, NEUT, and NuWro all implement special treatments for this transition region (e.g. non-resonant background in the resonance region, to avoid a discontinuity between RES and DIS). GiBUU’s seamless approach shines here by not requiring an arbitrary switch between models – it transitions resonances to DIS smoothly. In practice, **all generators can cover 1–5 GeV** with their full repertoire of processes. Differences in this energy range come down to model choices (as detailed in the previous section) rather than outright inability to simulate. For example, at 2 GeV a GENIE simulation will blend resonances and DIS according to its tuned model, whereas GiBUU will naturally produce a similar blend. NuWro and NEUT are also capable of the full mix of interactions in this range. All have been compared to experiment data here (discussed in the next section).

* **Multi-GeV (5–50 GeV)**: In this regime DIS and high-multiplicity events become dominant. GENIE is thoroughly used up to at least 50 GeV (for MINOS and NOMAD studies, and DUNE predictions) and even up to hundreds of GeV for IceCube and other cosmic neutrino analyses. NEUT has been used for atmospheric neutrino predictions up to tens of GeV (Hyper-Kamiokande atmospheric analyses plan to use it) and even up to O(100 GeV) as it claims, although the core user base (T2K) doesn’t extend that high. NuWro can technically go to high energies using PYTHIA for hadronization; however, it is less tuned there and not commonly used for, say, 100 GeV neutrinos. GiBUU’s practical upper limit is around a few tens of GeV – it was compared with NOMAD (20–100 GeV neutrinos) and could reproduce inclusive cross sections reasonably, but beyond that, one encounters diminishing returns (the DIS cross sections at very high energy have effects like heavy nuclear shadowing which GiBUU hasn’t extensively tuned).

* **Ultra-high energy (>100 GeV)**: GENIE stands out as it is designed to handle neutrinos in the hundreds of GeV to TeV range (for example, it’s used in simulations for IceCube, which deals with TeV-PeV neutrinos). It does so by using extrapolated DIS cross sections and simple nuclear models (e.g. it can treat the nucleus as a collection of nucleons with shadowing corrections turned on). NEUT’s documentation also claims coverage up to a few TeV – for instance, in Super-Kamiokande, neutrino interactions up to \~TeV are possible from cosmic ray muon neutrinos. In NEUT, these would be handled by the DIS model (with assumptions of free-nucleon cross sections, since very little data exists to tune beyond \~100 GeV). NuWro is not typically used in this domain, and GiBUU is generally not used at all at ultra-high energy.

In general, **GENIE and NEUT have the broadest claimed energy ranges**, reflecting their roles in oscillation experiments that need to simulate everything from few tens of MeV (supernova/solar neutrinos or reactor backgrounds in detectors) to multi-GeV (accelerator beams) to \~TeV (atmospheric neutrino backgrounds). They achieve this breadth by stitching together models (each valid in certain regimes) and extrapolating as needed. **NuWro** targets the *intermediate energy range* (roughly 0.1–10 GeV) most relevant for current cross-section measurements and is seldom used outside that. **GiBUU** targets a similar intermediate range, and while it was extended to DIS, it is best validated from hundreds of MeV to of order 10 GeV.

Each generator’s performance across energies is ultimately judged by how well it matches data, which we address next.

## Comparison with Experimental Data

A crucial test of these generators is how their predictions compare with measurements from key neutrino scattering experiments. We will discuss a few representative experiments: **MiniBooNE** (low-energy \$\nu\_\mu\$ on CH), **T2K** (low-energy \$\nu\_\mu\$ on carbon/oxygen), **MINERvA** (medium-energy \$\nu\_\mu\$ on CH), **MicroBooNE** (low-energy \$\nu\_\mu\$ on argon), and **NOMAD** (high-energy \$\nu\_\mu\$ on carbon). These experiments have provided a wealth of cross-section data that have challenged and driven improvements in all four generators.

* **MiniBooNE (0.8 GeV \$\langle E\_\nu \rangle\$, \$\nu\_\mu\$ on CH<sub>2</sub>):** MiniBooNE’s 2010 CCQE measurement on carbon was a watershed – it reported a \$\nu\_\mu\$ CCQE cross-section significantly higher than predicted by baseline models at the time. Both GENIE and NEUT (and the then-used NEUANCE generator) had to be tweaked to match MiniBooNE’s results, typically by using a larger effective axial mass (M<sub>A</sub>\~1.35 GeV instead of \~1.0 GeV) to increase QE cross-section. This was a clue that additional nuclear effects (like 2p2h) were missing. Indeed, MiniBooNE’s data were “CCQE-like,” including events where the neutrino scatters on a nucleon pair (2p2h) and no pion is in the final state. Over the past decade, all generators added MEC/2p2h as described above. **Outcome:** With these improvements, GENIE, NEUT, and NuWro can now reproduce MiniBooNE’s measured double-differential cross sections *without* artificially high M<sub>A</sub>, by including RPA suppression at low \$Q^2\$ and multi-nucleon enhancements. GiBUU, which did not include MEC at the time of the MiniBooNE result, predicted a lower QE-like cross-section – it agreed with old bubble-chamber QE data but sat **well below MiniBooNE’s QE-like data**. After adding MEC, GiBUU’s prediction moves closer to the MiniBooNE results (and GiBUU always included some pion absorption FSI that produces QE-like final states, which partially accounted for the difference). It’s worth noting that no generator anticipated the MiniBooNE result a priori – the data drove the models. Today, MiniBooNE’s results are generally **consistent with the generators** when they are run in configurations that include the known nuclear effects (in fact, MicroBooNE later observed that MiniBooNE’s data agree well with GENIE when both RPA and 2p2h are included). MiniBooNE also measured pion production: generators like GENIE and NEUT required retuning of \$\Delta\$ resonance contributions to not overpredict certain channels (e.g. CC1\$\pi^+\$) – for instance, GENIE reduced non-resonant background in its tunes to better fit MiniBooNE pion production. GiBUU’s pion production was found to be slightly low in some cases (it tends to absorb some pions via FSI). Overall, **MiniBooNE spurred the incorporation of MEC in all generators**, and after these updates all four can reasonably reproduce MiniBooNE’s cross sections within systematic uncertainties.

* **T2K (0.6 GeV \$\nu\_\mu\$ on C/H<sub>2</sub>O):** T2K’s near detector measurements have provided detailed cross sections on carbon (mostly hydrocarbon, and some on water). T2K uses NEUT as its primary simulation, and they have tuned NEUT’s parameters (M<sub>A</sub>, 2p2h normalization, etc.) to T2K ND data. As a result, **NEUT shows good agreement with T2K measurements** by construction. More interesting is how the other generators fare. Generally, when run in similar configurations, GENIE and NuWro also can describe T2K spectra (T2K’s flux is similar to MiniBooNE’s but with different detector and targets). One observation from T2K’s analyses is a slight preference for models with more realistic nuclear ground state and FSI: for instance, in some T2K cross-section fits, the GiBUU prediction (which uses a realistic nuclear model) was found to better match certain distributions than Fermi-gas based models. In a 2023 T2K study, data showed a *slight preference for GiBUU* over other generators, attributing it to GiBUU’s treatment of the nuclear ground state and consistent modeling of all channels. This doesn’t mean GiBUU is perfect, but it suggests that aspects like the spectral function and coupled-channel FSI in GiBUU improve agreement for, say, the momentum imbalance between final-state muon and proton (a probe of FSI and nuclear motion). T2K has also measured coherent pion production at \~1 GeV; NEUT (Rein-Sehgal) and GENIE (Rein-Sehgal or Berger-Sehgal) predicted a small rate, and indeed T2K observed a small but non-zero coherent cross section consistent with those predictions (NuWro and GiBUU, without explicit coherent channel, would underpredict this slightly, but within the large uncertainties it wasn’t decisive). In summary, **T2K data can be described by all generators once they are tuned**. There is no glaring discrepancy like MiniBooNE’s at T2K’s energies after including RPA and 2p2h. However, differences between models are still notable: for example, spectral function vs Fermi gas impacts the shape of muon kinematics, and T2K data favored those models that suppress very low momentum protons (pointing to FSI or correlations). GiBUU naturally has that suppression via FSI, whereas GENIE/NEUT had to tune it.

* **MINERvA (≈3 GeV \$\nu\_\mu\$ on CH):** MINERvA provided an extensive suite of cross-section measurements at energies where resonances and DIS start to dominate. Early comparisons revealed that no single model could predict all aspects of MINERvA data. For instance, MINERvA’s measurement of CCQE (defined without pions, so including 2p2h) at a few GeV found that a GENIE simulation with standard parameters **overpredicted** the cross section at higher energy transfer, whereas a GiBUU prediction (with no MEC at the time) **underpredicted** the normalization. The addition of MEC to GENIE improved the shape agreement. MINERvA also measured pion production: here, differences in FSI models became apparent. In comparing generators, MINERvA noted that pion spectra could differ due to how each handles pion FSI – e.g. GENIE’s hA FSI model vs. NuWro’s cascade led to slightly different momentum distributions of final pions as \$Q^2\$ increased. Overall, **MINERvA’s data did not show a clear favorite generator** – each had strengths in some areas and weaknesses in others. A Physics Reports article (2018) summarizing a generator comparison noted that while generators could often describe one experiment’s data when tuned, they struggled to simultaneously fit all experiments. For example, a GENIE tune that fit MiniBooNE and MINERvA QE data had to compromise between them. NuWro and GENIE, when configured with similar physics (RPA+MEC), gave similar results for MINERvA and generally agreed reasonably with data; GiBUU (with MEC now included) also agrees on inclusive cross sections. One particular area of MINERvA data is the high-\$\nu\$ (energy transfer) region in DIS events: GiBUU’s inclusion of nuclear shadowing could improve agreement for structure function ratios, but MINERvA’s medium energy is not low enough for shadowing to be dramatic. The consensus after MINERvA’s program is that **all generators required tuning to data** – GENIE developed new tunes (the GENIE 3.0.0 series) including MINERvA and other data; NuWro and NEUT also incorporated MINERvA results to adjust MEC model normalization. The data also exposed that **uncertainties were large** and often no single model was statistically distinguished. For instance, NOvA’s recent cross-section measurement (at \~2 GeV on carbon) compared GENIE, GiBUU, NEUT, NuWro and found that *no model is consistently favored across all observables* – some models do better for one variable and worse for another, and overall differences were within systematic errors.

* **MicroBooNE (0.8 GeV \$\nu\_\mu\$ on Ar):** MicroBooNE is a liquid argon TPC, and its cross-section measurements are an important test of generators on a heavier nucleus (argon, \$A=40\$) at similar energies to MiniBooNE. The argon target introduces nuclear effects (like higher Fermi momentum and different nuclear removal energy) that were not as crucial for carbon. MicroBooNE’s analyses have used GENIE as the primary generator (with a special “MicroBooNE tune” of GENIE 3 tuned to argon data). One of the notable findings was the need to adjust the nucleon removal energy in GENIE – the default GENIE spectral function model’s binding energy didn’t perfectly match electron-scattering data on argon, so MicroBooNE applied an empirical correction. This is exactly the kind of issue the “Electron-nucleus scattering in NEUT” study also addressed, deriving an empirical removal energy for argon. After such adjustments, GENIE could describe MicroBooNE’s measured muon and proton kinematics quite well. Comparisons showed that **GENIE, NEUT, and NuWro (with similar physics settings) all can be made to agree with MicroBooNE data**, within uncertainties. GiBUU’s predictions for argon (available for some observables) tend to give slightly different distributions – e.g. a bit more suppression of forward muons due to FSI – but generally are not too far off. MicroBooNE also looked at the *transverse kinematic imbalance* (TKI) variables to separate FSI and 2p2h effects. Those analyses (e.g. comparing T2K, MINERvA, MicroBooNE together) found that **no generator perfectly reproduces the distributions without tuning**, but by adjusting parameters like 2p2h normalization and FSI, the agreement improves. One interesting note: MicroBooNE did not see an excess of events beyond what GENIE (with MEC) predicted, suggesting that the tuned generators are indeed capturing the bulk of nuclear effects on argon. In summary, MicroBooNE’s argon data have largely validated the generators’ physics models on a heavier nucleus, while also highlighting the importance of proper nuclear initial state modeling (e.g. spectral functions) for argon. This pushed both GENIE and NuWro to implement new argon spectral functions. Active work is ongoing to ensure that simulations can seamlessly move from carbon to argon targets, a crucial step for the upcoming DUNE experiment.

* **NOMAD (10–100 GeV \$\nu\_\mu\$ on C):** NOMAD (at CERN) measured inclusive \$\nu\_\mu\$ cross sections and structure functions at higher energies in the 1990s. These high-energy data primarily test the DIS sector of the generators. GENIE and NEUT, with their DIS+PYTHIA approach, generally describe NOMAD’s total cross sections within \~10% after tuning of PDFs. One area of interest is nuclear *shadowing* at low \$x\$: NOMAD and MINOS data indicated some shadowing for neutrinos on heavy targets at tens of GeV. GiBUU stands out here by *attempting to include nuclear PDF effects*, as mentioned earlier. GiBUU’s results on iron and carbon at high energies showed that including nuclear shadowing similar to charged-lepton data yields better agreement with MINOS (iron) structure function measurements. No other generator at the time explicitly did this. However, for total cross sections in NOMAD’s region, all generators (GENIE, NEUT, NuWro) which use effective free-nucleon PDFs do reasonably well, since shadowing is a \~5–10% effect for carbon. GiBUU and GENIE have been directly compared to NOMAD’s data on the \$Q^2\$ distribution of events: both gave a fair description; differences were at the level of a few percent. Overall, **NOMAD’s high-energy data did not reveal major problems** – they serve as a confirmation that the DIS treatments are consistent with data when appropriate PDFs are used. All generators, if using updated PDFs and including known corrections, can match the measured total cross sections from NOMAD, within experimental uncertainties (which were \~4% or so). The main caution at high energy is whether the generators correctly model heavy-target effects – GENIE and NEUT now allow adding a shadowing correction for \$E\_\nu > 20\$ GeV (optional), and GiBUU inherently can include it. For most practical purposes (NOvA, DUNE in the few-GeV range, or atmospheric neutrinos up to tens of GeV), these differences are small, so **no significant disagreement with NOMAD remains after generators tuned their DIS parameters**.

To synthesize the data comparisons: Each generator can be made to agree with most experimental datasets after appropriate tuning of model parameters. However, **disagreements emerge when one uses a single fixed model across all experiments** – this was the so-called “tension” in neutrino scattering. For example, a global comparison noted that GiBUU (with no adjustments) gave the best agreement with some MiniBooNE and T2K distributions, while GENIE needed MEC and higher M<sub>A</sub> to do so. Conversely, GENIE/NEUT could better match MINERvA medium-energy data once tuned, whereas GiBUU (which wasn’t tuned) might underpredict some of those. A NOvA cross-section result in 2023 explicitly compared GENIE, GiBUU, NEUT, NuWro on the same footing and concluded that **no single generator was consistently favored across all measured observables** – some did better in certain kinematic regimes, others in different ones. This reinforces that each has certain physics strengths: e.g. GiBUU’s more realistic FSI might better predict final-state proton distributions, whereas GENIE/NEUT’s empirical tunes might better predict absolute normalization in specific channels due to tuning.

In practice, many experiments now use *multiple generators for cross-checks*. For instance, T2K and MINERvA have shown comparisons of their data to GENIE, NEUT, NuWro, and GiBUU to assess model uncertainties. These comparisons generally show all generators falling within the data error bands for most points, but with noticeable shape differences that hint at underlying physics model differences. It is common to see plots where GENIE and NEUT (both Fermi-gas based) cluster together in predictions, while GiBUU (transport-based) might predict slightly fewer high-momentum protons or fewer very forward muons. Experiments use these differences to gauge systematic uncertainties.

In summary, **agreement with data** is mixed: no generator is categorically “wrong” everywhere, but each required improvements spurred by data, and each still has areas where its predictions diverge from observations (usually at the \~10–20% level or in certain differential distributions). The continued development (e.g. GENIE’s new global fits, NEUT’s electron-scattering validations, NuWro’s updated nuclear models, GiBUU’s MEC addition) is a direct response to these comparisons, and each generator team has made strides to address past discrepancies.

## Practical Considerations

Beyond physics fidelity, practical aspects can be equally important when choosing an event generator for an experiment. These include computational speed, ease of use and flexibility, the ability to tune models to data, documentation and support, and the level of ongoing development/community engagement. We compare GENIE, NEUT, NuWro, and GiBUU on these practical metrics below.

### Speed and Computational Efficiency

**GENIE** is designed for large-scale Monte Carlo productions and generally runs very fast. It uses pre-tabulated cross sections and efficient rejection sampling to simulate events. A single CPU core can generate tens of thousands of events per second for energies in the GeV range (actual speed depends on the complexity of FSI modeling chosen – the hA FSI is extremely fast, hN cascade is slower but still reasonably efficient). Even at TeV energies with PYTHIA involved, GENIE remains manageable due to efficient sampling algorithms. Its broader scope (covering all processes up to PeV) does not dramatically slow it down because unneeded processes are simply not called at low energies, and vice versa.

**NEUT** is similarly efficient for its typical use-cases. It’s a FORTRAN/C++ based code (like GENIE) with many decades of optimization. NEUT’s FSI cascade, while detailed, was written with speed in mind and uses simplified nuclear geometry to expedite calculations. For T2K production, NEUT can generate on the order of \$10^7\$ events in hours without issues. At very high energies, NEUT calls PYTHIA for hadronization which adds some overhead, but in general NEUT’s performance is comparable to GENIE for equivalent event samples. One constraint is that NEUT is not as freely available for distributed computing outside its collaborations, so typically speed is assessed in collaboration-controlled environments.

**NuWro** is a smaller-scale program, but it’s quite lightweight and fast as well. It is written in C++ with a focus on simplicity, so for a given number of events, NuWro often runs quickly. Its intranuclear cascade is somewhat simpler than GENIE/NEUT’s full cascade, which can make it faster per event. It also does not by default generate as many secondary interactions (unless enabled), saving time. In benchmarks by users, NuWro has been able to produce event samples of size \~\$10^5\$–\$10^6\$ fairly swiftly on a single core. Where NuWro can slow down is if one enables computationally expensive options (like very detailed spectral function sampling or certain sophisticated hadronization features), but those are optional. Overall, speed is not a major issue for NuWro either, given its typical usage is for cross-section studies rather than generating billions of events for full detector simulations.

**GiBUU** is notably **slower** than the others. Because GiBUU effectively performs a microscopic simulation for each event (solving transport equations with possibly hundreds of time steps for particle propagation), generating large samples can be time-consuming. For example, to simulate one interaction, GiBUU might propagate the initial hadrons through many small time increments, checking for collisions at each step. If an event has multiple particles, all are tracked until they either escape or are absorbed. This level of detail is computationally heavy. GiBUU developers have optimized the code significantly (and one can run it in multi-threaded mode or on clusters), but it remains true that GiBUU is not ideal for producing millions of events quickly. Experiments generally do not use GiBUU for full detector simulations due to this – instead, they might use GiBUU to generate smaller theory-driven samples or predictions for comparison. For instance, obtaining smooth distributions from GiBUU often involves running a large number of events (with some event weighting technique) which can take considerable CPU time. To put in perspective: a GiBUU job to produce, say, 100k events with final-state details might take many hours on a single core, whereas GENIE/NEUT would do that in minutes. This difference in speed is one reason GiBUU hasn’t been adopted as a primary generator for experiments – it’s “hard to use as a primary input” partly because of the computational cost. That said, for targeted studies and lower statistics needs, GiBUU’s speed is manageable, and the physics insight it provides can justify the extra CPU cycles in those cases.

### Flexibility and Tunability

**GENIE** is highly configurable. It provides many switches and parameters to turn processes on/off or to tweak model parameters. For example, one can easily switch the nuclear model (RFG vs. LFG vs. SF) via configuration files, select different tunes (sets of parameters) that GENIE provides (e.g. the “GENIE G18\_10a” tune vs “G18\_02a” which differ in how RPA/MEC are handled), or adjust parameters like M<sub>A</sub>, 2p2h normalization, pion FSI mean free paths, etc., via a reweighting framework. GENIE’s recent versions come with a **reweighting toolkit** that allows users to vary dozens of parameters without regenerating events, which is extremely useful for systematic uncertainty evaluation and tuning. This makes GENIE very flexible for fitting to data. In terms of model options, GENIE has incorporated multiple alternatives (as noted, two options for coherent, two for FSI, different DIS splines, etc.), though it sometimes lags behind NuWro in quickly adding the latest theory model. Still, for most practical purposes, GENIE’s flexibility is excellent – users can simulate any neutrino species on any target with essentially any process combination from nuclear decay to deep inelastic scattering with minimal changes. Its plug-in architecture even allows user-defined new interaction types if one is an expert developer.

**NEUT** is somewhat less openly flexible (in terms of user-facing configuration) because historically it was maintained within a collaboration and specific tunes were hard-coded. However, this has improved. NEUT 5+ allows different model configurations: for instance, T2K has used alternate NEUT configurations with spectral function vs. Fermi gas, or with 2p2h on vs. off, to evaluate systematics. NEUT’s code (which has become partially open via publications and limited distribution) can be recompiled with different settings. There is also a NEUT reweighting library (similar to GENIE’s) used by T2K, so parameters like M<sub>A</sub>, 2p2h normalizations, and pion FSI probabilities can be varied continuously. In terms of quickly incorporating new models, NEUT’s smaller team means it tends to implement new features when needed for T2K/Hyper-K analysis rather than providing a large array of options to users. For example, NEUT added the Nieves RPA and 2p2h models because T2K data demanded it – but it might not have an option for, say, an alternate 2p2h model like Martini’s, since that wasn’t required by T2K. So NEUT is flexible **within the scope of mainstream models** but not as much a general theory testbed as NuWro. It is highly tunable (the T2K oscillation analysis involves tuning NEUT parameters with near detector data, demonstrating this).

**NuWro** is arguably the most flexible in terms of trying out different theoretical models. It was built with a modular structure that allows swapping in different ingredients. Users can choose global vs local Fermi gas, or Benhar spectral function, via an input card. One can choose to include or exclude RPA. There are options for using different pion production models (Rein-Sehgal or other experimental fits). In recent updates, NuWro has implemented the SuSA (superscaling) approach as an alternative model for QE and MEC. Because it’s a research-oriented tool, NuWro often incorporates new models quickly for testing – for example, when a new calculation for 2p2h or a new argon spectral function becomes available, NuWro developers add it and release a version. The trade-off is that some options may be less validated or documented. But from a tunability standpoint, NuWro is very user-friendly: its **input parameter file** exposes many physics parameters (cut-offs, masses, form factor shapes, etc.) that an advanced user can modify to see the impact. Moreover, NuWro’s code being open source (on GitHub) means the community can implement custom changes. This flexibility extends to output format as well – one can easily obtain various kinematic distributions or modify what the event record contains. In summary, **NuWro is ideal for exploring model systematics** and testing alternate physics hypotheses, thanks to its multiplicity of choices and simpler codebase.

**GiBUU** is a more closed framework in terms of flexibility. It is a full theoretical simulation that was developed as a cohesive model; it’s not intended for users to swap out, say, the pion production model on a whim. Many aspects are internally consistent (e.g. if you changed the nuclear potential, it would affect many channels). That said, GiBUU input files do allow some parameter variation – e.g. one can change the \$\Delta\$ resonance interaction probability or turn off FSI entirely as a test. But these are limited compared to the other generators. GiBUU doesn’t easily allow using an alternate nuclear model or disabling a particular channel without potentially breaking consistency. It also lacks a public reweighting package (though one could manually reweight events after the fact, it’s not provided). As a result, GiBUU is **less flexible/tunable** in a plug-and-play sense. If one wanted to, for example, test a different RPA calculation in GiBUU, it would require coding it into the model and solving the transport equations with it – a non-trivial task. In practice, GiBUU has been used in its default mode (with maybe minor tweaks) to provide predictions rather than a range of variations. The GiBUU team focuses on getting the physics right *a priori* rather than giving knobs to tune arbitrarily. This philosophy means experiments don’t tune GiBUU – they either use it as is, or not at all. While this yields predictive power, it’s a drawback for integration into oscillation fits, which rely on the ability to adjust models to fit near-detector data. In short, **GiBUU sacrifices user-tunability for theoretical consistency**.

### Documentation and Ease of Integration

**GENIE** is well-documented and built for integration. It has an extensive user manual and publication record (the GENIE v3 Manual and numerous conference proceedings) explaining both physics and technical use. The software is distributed with clear build instructions, and it uses standard outputs (ROOT format event files) that are easy to interface with analysis software. GENIE provides utilities like **flux drivers** (to read beam flux files) and **geometry drivers** (to simulate interactions in complex detector geometries), which make it straightforward to integrate GENIE into an experiment’s full simulation chain. Indeed, frameworks like LArSoft for liquid argon TPCs have GENIE integrated as the neutrino generator, and neutrino experiments at Fermilab (NOvA, MicroBooNE, DUNE) all plug GENIE into their simulation software almost out-of-the-box. There is also an official support forum and mailing list for GENIE where users can ask questions. The combination of thorough documentation, examples, and existing user base means new students or postdocs can learn GENIE relatively quickly. The ease of integration is exemplified by GENIE’s ability to read a neutrino flux histogram, simulate interactions in a given material (optionally with spatial variations using a GDML geometry), and output a file of four-vectors – all with a few configuration lines. This suits large collaborations that want a ready-to-use tool.

**NEUT**, being more specialized, historically had sparse public documentation – knowledge was often transmitted internally in T2K. However, this has changed recently: the NEUT authors published a comprehensive description in 2021, and they have also provided technical notes for users. NEUT isn’t packaged with as many user-friendly tools as GENIE (for example, one needs to supply their own flux handling, though T2K has code for that, and geometry handling is simpler since T2K’s near detector is basically a uniform target). Integration-wise, NEUT is deeply integrated into the T2K software environment (the ND280 software can call NEUT libraries directly for event generation). Outside of T2K/SK, integration is less straightforward because NEUT was not initially meant for broad external use. Some other experiments (e.g. SciBooNE, an old FNAL experiment, also used NEUT in the past) have integrated it, so it’s not impossible – but typically one would need to get the NEUT source (permission or request if not public), compile it, and adapt it to their framework. NEUT’s output format is also ROOT-based, so reading its events isn’t difficult if one has the libraries. Documentation on how to configure NEUT might not be as step-by-step for outsiders as GENIE’s is. But for those in the community who need it (Hyper-Kamiokande, etc.), the support is there. In summary, **NEUT is very well integrated into its native experiments’ workflows (with good internal documentation), but is less plug-and-play for outsiders**. The publication of NEUT details and efforts like NEUT’s electron-scattering validation show the team is working to make it more transparent and reliable for broader use.

**NuWro** is moderately easy to use. It is open source and comes with a **User Guide** that explains how to install and run it. Since it’s a smaller project, the documentation might not cover every edge case, but it’s sufficient for typical use. The output is provided in simple text or ROOT formats, and the project includes some ROOT macros to analyze output. Integration with large frameworks is not common – experiments usually don’t use NuWro as their primary generator. However, tools like NUISANCE (a generator comparison framework) have integrated NuWro alongside GENIE and NEUT, demonstrating that it’s feasible to plug NuWro into comparison workflows. The ease of integration is somewhat hindered by the fact that NuWro doesn’t have built-in flux or geometry machinery – users have to generate interactions in a static target. But one can always generate NuWro events and then overlay them onto a detector simulation. Because it’s a lightweight code, building and running NuWro is straightforward (no external dependencies like PYTHIA need separate installation; everything is bundled). Community support for NuWro is informal – one can reach out to the developers (Sobczyk et al.) or ask questions in neutrino forums, and the developers are known to respond helpfully. The open development on GitHub also means issues can be filed and tracked. Overall, **NuWro is relatively easy for a knowledgeable user to set up and run** for standalone studies, but it’s not provided as a ready-made component of large experimental software (unlike GENIE). Its documentation, while not as glossy as GENIE’s, covers the basics, and the source code is accessible for clarification if needed.

**GiBUU** has a steeper learning curve and integration challenge. The GiBUU code is available from a HepForge repository (under certain conditions – one typically registers to download it) and comes with a manual describing its theoretical basis. However, using GiBUU requires more effort: one must prepare input “job cards” that specify all aspects of the simulation (target nucleus, neutrino energy distribution, what outputs to produce, etc.). The documentation is primarily aimed at practitioners familiar with nuclear theory, and less at turn-key usage. Integrating GiBUU with an experiment’s full simulation is unusual; instead, one would run GiBUU standalone to produce, say, a library of events or cross-section predictions, and then compare those to experiment. The output of GiBUU can be a detailed file of particles exiting the nucleus, which one could then feed into a detector simulation, but doing so is custom work. GiBUU isn’t designed to read an experiment’s beam flux file or simulate a detector geometry directly – the typical workflow is to simulate interactions for a given neutrino energy or a grid of energies, then fold in the flux externally. That’s acceptable for cross-section analysis but not as convenient for full event simulation streams. The **ease of use is thus lowest for GiBUU**: it’s powerful but requires careful setup and interpretation. Community support is limited; essentially the Giessen group and a few others are the experts. There is no large user forum, though one can email the authors for help. Because of this, experiments have not adopted GiBUU as a routine tool – they use it as a one-off theory benchmark. In summary, **GiBUU is less documented for non-expert users and not structured for straightforward integration** into complex frameworks (it’s a standalone specialized simulation). It provides high-detail outputs but the user must work more to utilize them.

### Active Development and Community Support

All four generators are under active development, but the scale and community involvement differ:

* **GENIE** has a large, active team. It has formal releases (v3.0.0 in 2018, with subsequent updates like v3.2, v3.4, etc.) and a broad base of contributors from multiple institutions. GENIE development is often driven by the needs of new experiments (DUNE, Hyper-K, IceCube, etc.) and by comparisons to new data. It has a **GENIE collaboration** that meets regularly, and the project is supported by lab funding at places like Fermilab and University of Liverpool, etc. This means bugs are addressed, new features are added (for example, recent integration of radiative corrections for lepton bremsstrahlung, improvements in strange particle production, etc.), and there’s a roadmap for future versions. The community of GENIE users is large, and workshops or training sessions are held at neutrino schools to teach GENIE usage. Overall, support for GENIE is strong – a user can expect responses on its mailing lists and that their concerns will be considered in future versions. The widespread adoption of GENIE ensures that experimenters and theorists actively scrutinize it, leading to continuous improvement. For instance, after the NOvA cross-section results, GENIE developers looked into better tuning of 2p2h for NOvA’s energy, etc. GENIE’s active development is also evidenced by its frequent presence at conferences (e.g. talks on GENIE tuning, global analysis updates, etc.). In short, **GENIE has a vibrant development cycle and strong community support**, making it a “safe” choice for long-term projects.

* **NEUT** development is tied to the T2K/Hyper-K collaboration. It’s actively maintained, primarily by a few core developers in Japan and collaborators abroad (recently co-authored by Hayato and Pickering). NEUT’s updates often coincide with T2K analysis needs – e.g. incorporating a new model to reduce a bias, or optimizing for SK’s nucleon decay studies. The community of NEUT users is essentially the T2K and Super-K/Hyper-K analysis groups, which is a sizable community but not as broad as GENIE’s. They share code within the collaboration and support each other. NEUT is not as public-facing, but the 2021 paper and others indicate a push to document it for the wider community. As Hyper-K (a major upcoming experiment) relies on NEUT, one can be confident that NEUT will continue to be developed and supported through the 2020s. The number of active developers is smaller (on the order of 5–10 people contribute significantly), but they are responsive to issues that affect oscillation analyses. For example, when discrepancies in SK atmospheric neutrino modeling were found, NEUT was updated to address them. NEUT might not have the same frequency of public releases as GENIE, but it has internal versioning and periodic releases to collaborators. **Community support for NEUT is thus strong within its collaboration, but modest outside of it.** If a non-T2K group wanted to use NEUT, they would likely rely on contacting NEUT authors for assistance. Still, given the importance of NEUT to Japanese-led neutrino physics, it will remain a key player and see continuous improvement.

* **NuWro** is developed by a small group of neutrino theorists (at University of Wrocław and some collaborators). It does not have a large collaboration per se, but it has steadily evolved under the care of people like Jan Sobczyk, Artur Ankowski, and others. The development is somewhat *academic* in nature – they add features as new physics ideas emerge or to aid comparisons (e.g. implementing a new spectral function as part of a study). The user base of NuWro is smaller (mostly theorists and some phenomenologists), but the community is enthusiastic. For example, the NuSTEC (Neutrino Scattering Theory Exponents Collaboration) often uses NuWro for model comparison exercises, and NuWro developers are part of that effort. NuWro does have version releases (though not on a strict schedule; it’s more “when ready”). In recent years, they have integrated it with the NUISANCE comparison framework and are part of publications comparing generators. Because the code is open source, the community can contribute, but realistically most contributions come from the core team and a few power-users. Support is informal; one might get help by emailing the authors or asking a question at a conference. The development pace is a bit less intense than GENIE’s simply due to resources, but notable updates (like inclusion of Argon spectral functions, or new Semi-inclusive 2p2h models) continue to roll out. For instance, in 2023 the team published a paper on Argon spectral function implementation in NuWro. So, **NuWro is actively maintained on a best-effort basis by experts and remains a valuable community tool**, though without the formal support structure of a big experiment. Its future seems secure as long as neutrino scattering theory work continues, since it’s a go-to platform for testing theories.

* **GiBUU** historically was developed by Ulrich Mosel and his group at Giessen. They released versions of GiBUU (last major one around 2019, if memory serves) and have written extensive documentation and papers. As of 2025, Mosel has retired, but others like Kai Gallmeister have continued the project. The GiBUU website and HepForge show occasional updates; for example, a 2023 paper describing how MEC is included in GiBUU indicates ongoing development. However, the number of active developers is indeed *one or two*. This raises concern about long-term support – if those developers move on, GiBUU could become stagnant. On the other hand, GiBUU’s code is quite mature after \~15 years of development and covers much more than just neutrinos (it’s used for electron scattering, hadron scattering, etc. as well), so it may continue to attract interest from nuclear theorists. The community using GiBUU is small in neutrino context – often, GiBUU is used by its authors or by collaborations with them. Community support is limited; essentially one would direct questions to the GiBUU authors or attempt to glean from the literature. It’s not widely used by experimental collaborations as an official tool, so there isn’t an experiment help-desk for it. Despite that, GiBUU is highly respected in the neutrino theory community for its predictive power. Looking forward, GiBUU might not see rapid feature additions (since it already has a lot covered), but rather incremental improvements (such as better agreement with new data via minor tweaks). In summary, **GiBUU’s development is ongoing but with very few people**; its community support is minimal beyond those developers. Experiments value GiBUU’s input but are cautious to rely on it exclusively given the limited support and difficulty in tuning it to their needs.

To encapsulate practical differences: GENIE and NEUT are **experiment-focused and robustly supported** (GENIE globally, NEUT within its community), making them reliable for large-scale use. NuWro is **flexible and available**, used more for theoretical studies and method development, with a smaller but engaged support circle. GiBUU is **theoretically comprehensive** but **practically niche**, maintained by a tiny team and used selectively when its advanced physics is worth the extra effort.

## Advantages and Disadvantages of Each Generator

Finally, we summarize the key advantages and disadvantages of GENIE, NEUT, NuWro, and GiBUU, considering both physics fidelity and practical usage. Table 3 provides a concise comparison:

| **GENIE** | **Broad physics coverage:** Simulates all neutrino flavors, all targets, and all interaction channels from MeV to PeV energies. Comprehensive model suite (QE, RES, DIS, COH, etc.) with many improvements (RPA, MEC, tunes to data). **Widely validated:** Used by most neutrino experiments, tuned to a global set of scattering data, so default configurations give reasonable agreement with many measurements. **Highly configurable and supported:** Large development team and user community ensure regular updates and support. Easy integration (flux and geometry drivers, standard outputs) into experiment frameworks. Documentation is extensive, and a reweighting framework exists for systematic studies. In short, GENIE offers a “one-stop” solution with proven reliability.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | **Physical limitations (historical):** Default models (until recently) were somewhat rudimentary – e.g. Relativistic Fermi Gas nucleus and no long-range correlations – requiring empirical fixes (like an inflated axial mass) to match data. While much improved now, some physics treatments (e.g. hadron FSI in hA mode) are still phenomenological. **Tuning reliance:** GENIE’s predictive power depends on tuned parameters; if used outside tuned regimes (e.g. new nuclear targets or extreme energies), uncertainties grow. **Complexity:** Being comprehensive means GENIE has many options and parameters, which can be daunting for new users (though documentation helps). **Performance hit for detail:** Enabling more realistic but complex models (cascade FSI, spectral function) can slow down generation speed (still manageable, but slower than simplest mode). Overall, GENIE may trade a bit of microscopic accuracy for universality and speed, and users must be mindful of which tune/config they use to avoid old legacy settings that are less accurate.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| **NEUT**  | **Tuned for oscillation experiments:** NEUT’s models are optimized for the energy range of T2K/Super-K (sub-GeV to few GeV) and targets like water/carbon. It has demonstrated excellent agreement with these experiments’ internal data after tuning, which is crucial for oscillation analyses. **Solid nuclear physics improvements:** Incorporates sophisticated nuclear models (LFG, RPA, 2p2h) in recent versions, informed by electron-scattering and neutrino data. **Stable and well-tested:** Used for decades (Kamiokande, K2K, SK, T2K), so it’s a known quantity in its domain. **Adequate breadth:** Can handle interactions from \~100 MeV up to TeV scale, including nucleon decay and hadron–nucleus interactions (features specifically added for SK’s background simulations). **Integration and support within its community:** Strong expertise exists in T2K/SK groups, and NEUT is integrated with their software and detectors. This makes NEUT a dependable choice for those experiments and ensures active development driven by their needs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | **Limited user base and accessibility:** NEUT is mainly developed and used within a specific community; it’s not as freely available or easy to deploy for outsiders (no broad public releases or user forums like GENIE’s). Documentation, while improving, is not as comprehensive for new, external users. **Less general validation:** Global tuning is not as extensive – NEUT is superb for T2K/HK configurations, but outside that (other nuclei, higher energies) it may not be as thoroughly validated as GENIE. **Fewer model options exposed:** While NEUT has modern physics, it offers fewer alternate models; for example, one spectral function model, one MEC model (no menu of different MEC models to switch between). This reduces flexibility if one wanted to test radically different assumptions. **Small dev team:** Only a handful of core developers, which could mean slower response to new physics issues that don’t affect T2K directly. Practically, integration into non-Japanese experiments’ frameworks is doable but not plug-and-play. In summary, NEUT is somewhat **niche** – excellent for its design scope, but not as user-versatile or broadly validated beyond that.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| **NuWro** | **High physics fidelity options:** NuWro emphasizes theory elements – e.g. explicit spectral function implementation, various form factor parameterizations, optional coherence of amplitudes. It often is first to incorporate new theoretical models (being a sandbox for theorists). **Flexibility and user control:** Users can easily configure nuclear model, turn processes on/off, and adjust parameters via input files. This makes it great for testing the impact of different physics assumptions (e.g. one can run Fermi gas vs spectral function and compare). **Lightweight and fast:** The code is relatively simple and can be compiled and run on almost any system with minimal dependencies. Its event generator core is efficient, and it can be run interactively for quick studies. **Open source and transparent:** The source code and update history are public, and a reference publication list is available, so its physics content is transparent. **Good for cross-comparisons:** Because NuWro is independent and theory-driven, it provides a valuable cross-check to more tuned generators. It’s commonly used in generator comparisons and neutrino scattering workshops as an alternative perspective, often showing what changes in models can improve agreement with data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | **Limited usage in full experiments:** NuWro is not the primary generator of any major oscillation experiment, so it hasn’t been widely stress-tested in massive detector simulations or long-term oscillation analyses. This can mean less practical feedback on bugs or corner-cases. **Less tuning to data:** It doesn’t come with globally tuned parameter sets – defaults are physics-motivated, but if those don’t match some data, it’s on the user to adjust (the NuWro team has done some comparisons, but no exhaustive fit like GENIE’s global analysis). **Rudimentary integration tools:** It lacks built-in flux drivers or geometry interfaces; users must manually fold fluxes or simulate simple geometries, which is extra work for large-scale use. **Small support network:** With only a few developers, user questions rely on reaching one of them (though they are usually responsive, it’s not a formal support channel). **Maturing but not as exhaustive:** Some processes (like certain nuclear de-excitation gammas or specific BSM channels) that GENIE covers might not be in NuWro simply because focus has been on core interactions. Overall, NuWro trades comprehensive readiness for flexibility – it’s powerful in the hands of an expert, but novices might find less guidance and have to be careful interpreting its results without the extensive validation database others have.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| **GiBUU** | **Superior theoretical consistency:** GiBUU treats the neutrino–nucleus interaction as a coupled problem of particle production and transport. It **predicts** outcomes using physics laws (transport equations, potentials) rather than relying on many tunable knobs. This often yields very realistic results – e.g. nuclear effects like FSI are handled ab initio, giving GiBUU robust predictions for final-state particle distributions and correlations. **All relevant processes included:** QE, 2p2h (now), resonances, DIS, hadronization, FSI – all are there and handled in one framework. No need for patching between regimes (no “hard transition” between resonance and DIS, etc.), which avoids some artifacts present in other generators. **Nuclear ground state realism:** Using a mean-field potential and nuclear medium corrections, GiBUU inherently includes off-shell kinematics, Fermi motion and binding in a way that often outperforms simple models in reproducing electron-scattering data. **Predictive power:** GiBUU has had success predicting new results (e.g. it described muon + proton distributions before other generators adopted similar MEC/FSI tunes). Many regard GiBUU as a benchmark for what a fully dynamical simulation yields, making it a valuable check on other generators. **Multi-use framework:** The GiBUU code isn’t just for neutrinos – it has been benchmarked with hadron and electron scattering. This cross-validates its physics (the FSI model tuned to pion scattering, the nuclear model tuned to electron-nucleus, etc.), lending confidence that it gets the underlying physics right across reactions. | **Practical hurdles:** As noted, GiBUU is **difficult to integrate and slower to run** in an experimental context. One cannot easily plug GiBUU into an oscillation fit as the fast event generator – it’s too CPU-intensive for large samples and lacks a reweighting engine for systematic variations. This means experiments can’t use it for large-scale event production, limiting it to off-line studies. **Minimal tuning capability:** If GiBUU predictions disagree with some data, there’s no straightforward way for a user to “tune” it – one would have to modify the physics (which is a strength in principle, but a weakness for making quick fixes to match data). **Tiny development team:** With essentially one lead author for many years (now semi-retired) and a couple of collaborators, there’s a bus-factor risk. If those developers stop, updates may cease. Already, new features (like alternate models) are not added unless the core team does it. **User-unfriendliness:** Setting up GiBUU requires expertise; new students may struggle compared to using GENIE/NEUT. The documentation is theoretical and not a step-by-step “how to simulate my detector” guide. **Not tuned to oscillation environment:** GiBUU might not include all odd cases experiments care about (like specific energy reconstruction variables, or interfacing with specific detector simulation formats), since it’s not experiment-driven. In short, GiBUU’s **fidelity comes at the cost of convenience**. It’s an excellent reference but not a turnkey solution. Experiments often use it to double-check results but rely on easier tools for primary simulations. |

In conclusion, the choice of generator often depends on the context: GENIE’s extensive use and support make it a default for many, NEUT’s specialization makes it ideal for the water Cherenkov community, NuWro’s flexibility is valuable for theoretical explorations, and GiBUU’s detailed physics makes it a gold standard for understanding nuclear effects. Each has clear **advantages** – whether it be GENIE’s completeness, NEUT’s tuned accuracy at 1 GeV, NuWro’s customizability, or GiBUU’s physical rigor – and each has **trade-offs** in terms of ease-of-use and scope of validity. Modern neutrino analyses increasingly involve **comparative use** of these generators to assess uncertainties; no single generator is universally “best” on all fronts. Instead, they complement each other: e.g. GiBUU can identify where a simpler generator might be missing physics, NuWro allows testing new models quickly which can then be incorporated into GENIE/NEUT, and GENIE/NEUT provide the robust infrastructure needed for large-scale experimental simulations. The continued development and cross-comparisons of GENIE, NEUT, NuWro, and GiBUU are essential for reducing neutrino interaction systematic errors in oscillation experiments and for deepening our understanding of neutrino-nucleus dynamics.
